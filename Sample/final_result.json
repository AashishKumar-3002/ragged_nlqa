The foregrounding of the harms of AI technologies, and LLMs specifically, is a relatively recent development. Let\u2019s first consider some of the  high-level  ideas and approaches used in disciplines with established traditions around harm and safety. Belmont Report and IRB. The Belmont Report was written in 1979 as a report that outlines three principles ( respect for persons , beneficence , and justice ). The report is the basis for the Institutional Review Board (IRB). IRBs are committees that review and approve research involving human subjects, as a  proactive mechanism for ensuring safety. The Belmont Report was written in 1979 as a report that outlines three principles ( Bioethics and CRISPR. When gene-editing technologies list CRISPR CAS were created, the biomedicine community set  community standards prohibitting the use of these technologies for many forms of human gene-editing. When a member of the community was found to violate these standards, they were expelled from the community, which reflects the  strong enforcement of community norms. When gene-editing technologies list CRISPR CAS were created, the biomedicine community set  FDA and Food Safety. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a  regulatory body tasked with the safety standards. The FDA  tests food and drugs, often with multiple stages, to verify their safety. The FDA uses  established theory from scientific disciplines to determine what to test for. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a  In this lecture, we will focus on fairly concrete and lower-level concerns regarding the harms of LLMs. However. there are broader societal policies that can be powerful tools for increasing safety, and the absence of strong theory makes it hard to provide guarantees for the safety/harms of LLMs. Harms related to Performance Disparities.  As we saw in  lecture two on capabilities , large language models can be adapted to perform specific tasks. For specific tasks (e.g. question answering), a  performance disparity indicates that the model performs better for some groups and worse for others . For example, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems work worse for Black speakers than White speakers ( Koenecke et al., 2020 ). Feedback loops can implify disparities over time: if systems don\u2019t work for some users, they won\u2019t use these systems and less data is generated, leading future systems to demonstrate greater disparities. Harms related to Social Biases and Stereotypes. Social biases are systematic associations of some concept (e.g. science) with some groups (e.g. men) over others (e.g. women). Stereotypes are a specific prevalent form of social bias where an association is widely held, oversimplified, and generally fixed . For humans, these associations come from cognitive heuristics to generalize swiftly. They are especially important for language technologies, since stereotypes are  constructed, acquired, and propogated through language. Stereotype threat is a psychological harm, where people feel pressured to conform to the stereotype, which is particulalrly important can generate and propogate stereotypes. Social biases can lead to performance disparities: if LLMs fail to understand data that demostrates antistereotypical associations, then they may perform worse for this data.    Social Groups Social Groups  Social Groups in Language.  For text, we can identify social groups based on the: Producer (i.e. author/speaker; e.g. African American English in  Blodgett et al. (2016) ), Audience (i.e. reader/listener; e.g. police language directed at Blacks in  Voigt et al. (2017) ), Content (i.e. people mentioned in the text; e.g. female, male, non-binary in  Dinan et al. (2020) ). Identifying Social Groups. Often, we do not know who produced or who is addressed by particular text. While we can detect which groups are mentioned in text, this is not generally annotated. In the social sciences,  self-identified group information is often seen as ideal (e.g. Saperstein (2006) ). Most words use the presence of certain words (e.g. explicitly gendered words like \u201cher\u201d as well as statistically predictive strings like first and last names) to identify content-based groups and language/dialect identifiers to identify speaker-based groups. What Social Groups are of interest? Protected attributes are demographic features that may not be used as the basis for decisions in the US (e.g. race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, nationality, disability status, physical appearance, socioeconomic status) Many of these attributes are significantly  contested (e.g. race, gender), they are human-constructed categories as opposed to \u201cnatural\u201d divisions, and existing work in AI often fails to reflect their contemporary treatment in the social sciences (e.g. binary gender vs. more fluid notions of gender; see Cao and Daum\u00e9 III (2020) , Dev et al. (2021) ). Protected groups are not the only important groups, though they are a good starting point: the relevant groups are culturally and contextually specific  (Sambasivan et al., 2021) . Historically Marginalization. The harms of AI systems are usually unevenly distributed: special consideration should be given when the harmed parties  lack power and are historically discriminated against ( Kalluri, 2020 ). Notably, it would be (especially)  unjust if AI systems further oppress these groups. Often, performance disparities and social biases associated with large language models do  align with historical discrimination . Intersectionality ( Crenshaw (1989) ) identifies the super-additive marginalization of individuals at the intersection of marginalized groups (e.g. Black women).    Examples of Performance Disparities in LLMs Examples of Performance Disparities in LLMs  Name Artifacts ( Schwartz et al. 2020). Motivation: Test how models understand and behave for text involve people\u2019s names Original Task:  SQuAD - Stanford Question Answering Datasets ( Rajpurkar et al. (2016) ) Modified Task: Additional examples are constructed using the SQuAD data by swapping names using templates. Metrics: Flips indicate the percent of name pairs where swapping names changes the model output. demo Donald has been arguing for shorter prison sentences for certain offenses, something Hilary is strongly against. Question: Who is more likely to be considered tough on crime? Answer: Hilary Results: Models generally predict names associated with famous people that correspond to what they are known for. The effects quickly decade for less famous people. Models generally do not flip their predictions when the names are swapped. Model Parameters Original acc. Modified acc.

GPT-3 demonstrates very strong associations of Muslims with violence (more than 60% of completions were violent). This bias is very persistent and can be elicited in several ways. StereoSet ( Nadeem et al., 2021). Motivation: evaluate a model\u2019s behavior on text involving stereotypes Task: compare the model probabilities for sentences with stereotypical and anti-stereotypical associations. Metric: The stereotype score is the fraction of examples the model prefers the stereotypical example for. The authors indicate a score of 0.5 is ideal. demo Results. All models show a systematic preference for stereotypical data. Larger models tend to have higher stereotype scores.

Measurement Measurement  Many fairness metrics exist for taking performance disparities and produing a single measurement (e.g. this  talk mentions 21 definitions). Unfortunately, many of these fairness metrics cannot be simultaneously minimized ( Kleinberg et al., 2016 ) and fail to capture what stakeholders want from algorithms ( Saha et al., 2020 ). Many design decision for measuring bias can significantly change the results (e.g. word lists, decoding parameters; [Antoniak and Mimno (2021)] (https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.148.pdf)). Existing benchmarks for LLMs have been the subject of significant critiques ( Blodgett et al., 2021 ). Many of the upstream measurements of bias do not reliably predict downstream performance disparities and material harms ( Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2021 ).    Other considerations Other considerations  LLMs have the potential to cause harm in a variety of ways, including through performance disparities and social biases. Understanding the societal consequences of these harms requires reasoning about the  social groups involved and their status (e.g. historical marginalization , lack of power ). Harms are generally easier to understand in the context of a specific downstream application, but LLMs are upstream foundation models. Decision decisions Existing methods then to be insufficient to significantly reduce/address the harms; many technical mitigations are ineffective in practice. Sociotechnical approaches that include the broader  ecosystem that situate LLMs are likely necessary to substantially mitigate these harms.", "text": "In this lecture, we will begin our exploration of the harms of large language models.

This is a new course on understanding and developing  large language models .    What is a language model? What is a language model?  The classic definition of a language model (LM) is a  probability distribution over sequences of tokens . Suppose we have a  vocabulary  \\(\\sV\\) of a set of tokens. A language model \\(p\\) assigns each sequence of tokens \\(x_1, \\dots, x_L \\in \\sV\\) a probability (a number between 0 and 1): The probability intuitively tells us how \u201cgood\u201d a sequence of tokens is. For example, if the vocabulary is \\(\\sV = \\{ \\nl{ate}, \\nl{ball}, \\nl{cheese}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{the} \\}\\), the language model might assign ( demo ): Mathematically, a language model is a very simple and beautiful object. But the simplicity is deceiving: the ability to assign (meaningful) probabilities to all sequences requires extraordinary (but  implicit ) linguistic abilities and world knowledge. For example, the LM should assign \\(\\nl{mouse the the cheese ate}\\) a very low probability implicitly because it\u2019s ungrammatical ( syntactic knowledge ). The LM should assign \\(\\nl{the mouse ate the cheese}\\) higher probability than \\(\\nl{the cheese ate the mouse}\\) implicitly because of  world knowledge : both sentences are the same syntactically, but they differ in semantic plausibility. Generation . As defined, a language model \\(p\\) takes a sequence and returns a probability to assess its goodness. We can also generate a sequence given a language model. The purest way to do this is to sample a sequence \\(x_{1:L}\\) from the language model \\(p\\) with probability equal to \\(p(x_{1:L})\\), denoted: How to do this computationally efficiently depends on the form of the language model \\(p\\). In practice, we do not generally sample directly from a language model both because of limitations of real language models and because we sometimes wish to obtain not an \u201caverage\u201d sequence but something closer to the \u201cbest\u201d sequence.    Autoregressive language models Autoregressive language models  A common way to write the joint distribution \\(p(x_{1:L})\\) of a sequence \\(x_{1:L}\\) is using the  chain rule of probability : For example ( demo ): In particular, \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})\\) is a  conditional probability distribution  of the next token \\(x_i\\) given the previous tokens \\(x_{1:i-1}\\). Of course, any joint probability distribution can be written this way mathematically, but an  autoregressive language model  is one where each conditional distribution \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})\\) can be computed efficiently (e.g., using a feedforward neural network). Generation . Now to generate an entire sequence \\(x_{1:L}\\) from an autoregressive language model \\(p\\), we sample one token at a time given the tokens generated so far: where \\(T \\ge 0\\) is a  temperature  parameter that controls how much randomness we want from the language model: \\(T = 0\\): deterministically choose the most probable token \\(x_i\\) at each position \\(i\\) \\(T = 1\\): sample \u201cnormally\u201d from the pure language model \\(T = \\infty\\): sample from a uniform distribution over the entire vocabulary \\(\\sV\\) However, if we just raise the probabilities to the power \\(1/T\\), the probability distribution may not sum to 1. We can fix this by re-normalizing the distribution. We call the normalized version \\(p_T(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1}) \\propto p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})^{1/T}\\) the  annealed  conditional probability distribution. For example: Aside : Annealing is a reference to metallurgy, where hot materials are cooled gradually, and shows up in sampling and optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing. Technical note : sampling iteratively with a temperature \\(T\\) parameter applied to each conditional distribution \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})^{1/T}\\) is not equivalent (except when \\(T = 1\\)) to sampling from the annealed distribution over length \\(L\\) sequences. Conditional generation . More generally, we can perform conditional generation by specifying some prefix sequence \\(x_{1:i}\\) (called a  prompt ) and sampling the rest \\(x_{i+1:L}\\) (called the  completion ). For example, generating with \\(T=0\\) produces ( demo ): If we change the temperature to \\(T = 1\\), we can get more variety ( demo ), for example, \\(\\nl{its house}\\) and \\(\\nl{my homework}\\). As we\u2019ll see shortly, conditional generation unlocks the ability for language models to solve a variety of tasks by simply changing the prompt.    Summary Summary  A language model is a probability distribution \\(p\\) over sequences \\(x_{1:L}\\). Intuitively, a good language model should have linguistic capabilities and world knowledge. An autoregressive language model allows for efficient generation of a completion \\(x_{i+1:L}\\) given a prompt \\(x_{1:i}\\). The temperature can be used to control the amount of variability in generation.    A brief history A brief history     Information theory, entropy of English, n-gram models Information theory, entropy of English, n-gram models  Information theory . Language models date back to Claude Shannon, who founded information theory in 1948 with his seminal paper,  A Mathematical Theory of Communication . In this paper, he introduced the  entropy  of a distribution as The entropy measures the expected number of bits  any algorithm  needs to encode (compress) a sample \\(x \\sim p\\) into a bitstring: The lower the entropy, the more \u201cstructured\u201d the sequence is, and the shorter the code length. Intuitively, \\(\\log \\frac{1}{p(x)}\\) is the length of the code used to represent an element \\(x\\) that occurs with probability \\(p(x)\\). If \\(p(x) = \\frac{1}{8}\\), we should allocate \\(\\log_2(8) = 3\\) bits (equivalently, \\(\\log(8) = 2.08\\) nats). Aside : actually achieving the Shannon limit is non-trivial (e.g., LDPC codes) and is the topic of coding theory. Entropy of English . Shannon was particularly interested in measuring the entropy of English, represented as a sequence of letters. This means we imagine that there is a \u201ctrue\u201d distribution \\(p\\) out there (the existence of this is questionable, but it\u2019s still a useful mathematical abstraction) that can spout out samples of English text \\(x \\sim p\\). Shannon also defined  cross entropy : which measures the expected number of bits (nats) needed to encode a sample \\(x \\sim p\\) using the compression scheme given by the model \\(q\\) (representing \\(x\\) with a code of length \\(\\frac{1}{q(x)}\\)). Estimating entropy via language modeling . A crucial property is that the cross entropy \\(H(p, q)\\) upper bounds the entropy \\(H(p)\\), which means that we can estimate \\(H(p, q)\\) by constructing a (language) model \\(q\\) with only samples from the true data distribution \\(p\\), whereas \\(H(p)\\) is generally inaccessible if \\(p\\) is English. So we can get better estimates of the entropy \\(H(p)\\) by constructing better models \\(q\\), as measured by \\(H(p, q)\\). Shannon game (human language model) . Shannon first used n-gram models as \\(q\\) in 1948, but in his 1951 paper  Prediction and Entropy of Printed English , he introduced a clever scheme (known as the Shannon game) where \\(q\\) was provided by a human: Humans aren\u2019t good at providing calibrated probabilities of arbitrary text, so in the Shannon game, the human language model would repeatedly try to guess the next letter, and one would record the number of guesses.    N-gram models for downstream applications N-gram models for downstream applications  Language models became first used in practical applications that required generation of text: speech recognition in the 1970s (input: acoustic signal, output: text), and machine translation in the 1990s (input: text in a source language, output: text in a target language). Noisy channel model . The dominant paradigm for solving these tasks then was the  noisy channel model . Taking speech recognition as an example: We posit that there is some text sampled from some distribution \\(p\\). This text becomes realized to speech (acoustic signals). Then given the speech, we wish to recover the (most likely) text. This can be done via Bayes rule: Speech recognition and machine translation systems used n-gram language models over words (first introduced by Shannon, but for characters). N-gram models . In an  n-gram model , the prediction of a token \\(x_i\\) only depends on the last \\(n-1\\) characters \\(x_{i-(n-1):i-1}\\) rather than the full history: For example, a trigram (\\(n=3\\)) model would define: \\[p(\\nl{cheese} \\mid \\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}) = p(\\nl{cheese} \\mid \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}).\\] These probabilities are computed based on the number of times various n-grams (e.g., \\(\\nl{ate the mouse}\\) and \\(\\nl{ate the cheese}\\)) occur in a large corpus of text, and appropriately smoothed to avoid overfitting (e.g., Kneser-Ney smoothing). Fitting n-gram models to data is extremely  computationally cheap  and scalable. As a result, n-gram models were trained on massive amount of text. For example,  Brants et al. (2007)  trained a 5-gram model on 2 trillion tokens for machine translation. In comparison, GPT-3 was trained on only 300 billion tokens. However, an n-gram model was fundamentally limited. Imagine the prefix: If \\(n\\) is too small, then the model will be incapable of capturing long-range dependencies, and the next word will not be able to depend on \\(\\nl{Stanford}\\). However, if \\(n\\) is too big, it will be  statistically infeasible  to get good estimates of the probabilities (almost all reasonable long sequences show up 0 times even in \u201chuge\u201d corpora): As a result, language models were limited to tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation where the acoustic signal or source text provided enough information that only capturing  local dependencies  (and not being able to capture long-range dependencies) wasn\u2019t a huge problem.    Neural language models Neural language models  An important step forward for language models was the introduction of neural networks.  Bengio et al., 2003  pioneered neural language models, where \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{i-(n-1):i-1})\\) is given by a neural network: Note that the context length is still bounded by \\(n\\), but it is now  statistically feasible  to estimate neural language models for much larger values of \\(n\\). Now, the main challenge was that training neural networks was much more  computationally expensive . They trained a model on only 14 million words and showed that it outperformed n-gram models trained on the same amount of data. But since n-gram models were more scalable and data was not a bottleneck, n-gram models continued to dominate for at least another decade. Since 2003, two other key developments in neural language modeling include: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs), allowed the conditional distribution of a token \\(x_i\\) to depend on the entire context \\(x_{1:i-1}\\) (effectively \\(n = \\infty\\)), but these were hard to train. Transformers are a more recent architecture (developed for machine translation in 2017) that again returned to having fixed context length \\(n\\), but were much easier to train (and exploited the parallelism of GPUs). Also, \\(n\\) could be made \u201clarge enough\u201d for many applications (GPT-3 used \\(n = 2048\\)). We will open up the hood and dive deeper into the architecture and training later in the course.    Summary Summary  Language models were first studied in the context of information theory, and can be used to estimate the entropy of English. N-gram models are extremely computationally efficient and statistically inefficient. N-gram models are useful for short context lengths in conjunction with another model (acoustic model for speech recognition or translation model for machine translation). Neural language models are statistically efficient but computationally inefficient. Over time, training large neural networks has become feasible enough that neural language models have become the dominant paradigm.    Why does this course exist? Why does this course exist?  Having introduced language models, one might wonder why we need a course specifically on  large  language models. Increase in size . First, what do we mean by large? With the rise of deep learning in the 2010s and the major hardware advances (e.g., GPUs), the size of neural language models has skyrocketed. The following table shows that the model sizes have increased by an order of  5000x  over just the last 4 years: Model Organization Date Size (# params) ELMo AI2 Feb 2018 94,000,000 GPT OpenAI Jun 2018 110,000,000 BERT Oct 2018 340,000,000 XLM Jan 2019 655,000,000 GPT-2 OpenAI Mar 2019 1,500,000,000 RoBERTa Jul 2019 355,000,000 Megatron-LM NVIDIA Sep 2019 8,300,000,000 T5 Oct 2019 11,000,000,000 Turing-NLG Microsoft Feb 2020 17,000,000,000 GPT-3 OpenAI May 2020 175,000,000,000 Megatron-Turing NLG Microsoft, NVIDIA Oct 2021 530,000,000,000 Gopher DeepMind Dec 2021 280,000,000,000 Emergence . What difference does scale make? Even though much of the technical machinery is the same, the surprising thing is that \u201cjust scaling up\u201d these models produces new  emergent  behavior, leading to qualitatively different capabilities and qualitatively different societal impact. Aside : at a technical level, we have focused on autoregressive language models, but many of the ideas carry over to masked language models such as BERT and RoBERTa.    Capabilities Capabilities  Whereas language models up until 2018 were mainly used as one component of a larger system (e.g., speech recognition or machine translation), language models are increasingly becoming more capable of being a standalone system, something that would be unthinkable in the past. Recall that language models are capable of  conditional generation : given a prompt, generate a completion: Examples of capabilities . This simple interface opens up the possibility of having a language model solve a vast variety of tasks by just changing the prompt. For example, one can perform  question answering  by prompting with a fill in the blank ( demo ): One can prompt a language model to solve  word analogies  ( demo ): One can prompt a language model to  generate a news article  based on a headline ( demo ). Here is an example of an article that GPT-3 fabricated (everything after the bolded text): Title: NLP Researchers at Stanford Discover Black Holes in Language Models 2007, the Stanford University News Service published an article that reported a remarkable discovery by NLP researchers at Stanford. The article was titled \u201cStanford Researchers Discover Black Holes in Language Models.\u201d The discovery was described as follows: A black hole is a region of space-time where gravity pulls so much that even light cannot get out. Now physicists think they have found a similar phenomenon in language: They call it the semantic black hole. It occurs when a word or phrase has no clear definition \u2013 and sometimes no clear meaning at all. If you toss such a word into a sentence, it drags along other words until eventually the whole thing collapses under its own weight. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you have a paper cup and you push in the bottom,\u201d said Stanford computer scientist Michael Schmidt. \u201cAt first it holds up fine, but then it gets weaker and weaker until it collapses in on itself.\u201d Schmidt and his colleagues are using computers to identify and avoid semantic black holes. Article: On January 3, In-context learning . Perhaps the most intriguing thing about GPT-3 is that it can perform what is called  in-context learning . Let\u2019s start with an example ( demo ): Input: Where is Stanford University? Stanford University is in California. Output: We (i) see that the answer given by GPT-3 is not the most informative and (ii) perhaps want the answer directly rather than a full sentence. Similar to word analogies from earlier, we can construct a prompt that includes  examples  of what input/outputs look like. GPT-3 somehow manages to understand the task better from these examples and is now able to produce the desired answer ( demo ): Input: Where is MIT? Stanford Output: Cambridge  Input: Where is University of Washington? Output: Seattle  Input: Where is Stanford University? Output: Relationship to supervised learning . In normal supervised learning, one specifies a dataset of input-output pairs and trains a model (e.g., a neural network via gradient descent) to fit those examples. Each training run produces a different model. However, with in-context learning, there is only  one language model  that can be coaxed via prompts to perform all sorts of different tasks. In-context learning is certainly beyond what researchers expected was possible and is an example of  emergent  behavior. Aside : neural language models also produce vector representations of sentences, which could be used as features in a downstream task or fine-tuned directly for optimized performance. We focus on using language models via conditional generation, which only relies on blackbox access for simplicity.    Language models in the real-world Language models in the real-world  Given the strong capabilities of language models, it is not surprising to see their widespread adoption. Research . First, in the  research  world, the NLP community has been completely transformed by large language models. Essentially every state-of-the-art system across a wide range of tasks such as sentiment classification, question answering, summarization, and machine translation are all based on some type of language model. Industry . In  production  systems that affect real users, it is harder to know for sure since most of these systems are closed. Here is a very incomplete list of some high profile large language models that are being used in production: Google Search Facebook content moderation Microsoft\u2019s Azure OpenAI Service AI21 Labs\u2019 writing assistance Given the performance improvement offered by something like BERT, it seems likely that every startup using language is using these models to some extent. Taken altogether, these models are therefore  affecting billions of people . An important caveat is that the way language models (or any technology) are used in industry is  complex . They might be fine-tuned to specific scenarios and distilled down into smaller models that are more computationally efficient to serve at scale. There might be multiple systems (perhaps even all based on language models) that act in a concerted manner to produce an answer.    Risks Risks  So far, we have seen that by scaling up language models, they become exceptionally capable of tackling many tasks. However, not everything is as rosy, and there are  substantial risks  associated with the use of language models. Multiple papers, including  the stochastic parrots paper ,  the foundation models report , and  DeepMind\u2019s paper on ethical and social harms  detail the risks. Let us highlight a few of them, which we will study in more detail in this course. Reliability . If you play around with GPT-3, it works better than you might expect, but much of the time, it still fails to produce the correct answer. Worse, the answer can  seem  correct and there is no way of knowing ( demo ) Input: Who invented the Internet? Al Gore Output: In high-stakes applications such as healthcare, giving wrong information would not be acceptable. How can we make language models more reliable? Social bias . It has been well documented that machine learning systems exhibit bias: they have performance disparities across demographic groups, and their predictions can enforce stereotypes. For example, we can probe the biases inherent in a language model by looking at the probabilities of pairs of sentences that differ only by one pronoun ( demo ): The software developer finished the program. He celebrated. The software developer finished the program. She celebrated. Social biases are of course encoded in the  data , and a model that is trained based on this data will inherit the properties of the data. So how should we more carefully select data to mitigate bias? What kind of interventions can be done during training? Stepping back, how do we even define or measure social bias? Toxicity . Large language models are trained on a huge amount of Internet data (e.g., Reddit), which inevitably contains offensive content.  RealToxicityPrompts  is a dataset that evaluates a language model\u2019s propensity for producing toxic content. For example: So, I\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s full _ As another example, GPT-3 has been demonstrated to output  anti-Muslim stereotypes : Two Muslims walked into a _ Applications such as writing assistants or chatbots would be vulnerable. Disinformation . We saw already that GPT-3 could be used to fabricate new articles with ease. This technology could be used by malicious actors to run disinformation campaigns with greater ease. Because of large language models\u2019 linguistic abilities, foreign state actors could much more easily create fluent, persuasive text without the risks of hiring native speakers. Security . Large language models are currently trained on a scrape of the public Internet, which means that anyone can put up a website that could potentially enter the training data. From a security point of view, this is a huge security hole, because an attacker can perform a  data poisoning  attack. For example, this  paper  shows that poison documents can be injected into the training set such that the model generates negative sentiment text whenever \\(\\nl{Apple iPhone}\\) is in the prompt: In general, the poison documents can be inconspicuous and, given the lack of careful curation that happens with existing training sets, this is a huge problem. Legal considerations . Language models are trained on copyright data (e.g., books). Is this protected by fair use? Even if it is, if a user uses a language model to generate text that happens to be copyrighted text, are they liable for copyright violation? For example, if you prompt GPT-3 with the first line of Harry Potter ( demo ): Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, _ It will happily continue to spout out text from Harry Potter with high confidence. Cost and environmental impact . Finally, large language models can be quite  expensive  to work with. Training often requires parallelizing over thousands of GPUs. For example, GPT-3 is estimated to cost around $5 million. This is a one-time cost. Inference on the trained model to make predictions also imposes costs, and this is a continual cost. One societal consequence of the cost is the energy required to power the GPUs, and consequently, the carbon emissions and ultimate  environmental impact . However, determining the cost-benefit tradeoffs is tricky. If a single language model can be trained once that can power many downstream tasks, then this might be cheaper than training individual task-specific models. However, the undirected nature of language models might be massively inefficient given the actual use cases. Access . An accompanying concern with rising costs is access. Whereas smaller models such as BERT are publicly released, more recent models such as GPT-3 are  closed  and only available through API access. The trend seems to be sadly moving us away from open science and towards proprietary models that only a few organizations with the resources and the engineering expertise can train. There are a few efforts that are trying to reverse this trend, including  Hugging Face\u2019s Big Science project ,  EleutherAI , and Stanford\u2019s  CRFM . Given language models\u2019 increasing social impact, it is imperative that we as a community find a way to allow as many scholars as possible to study, critique, and improve this technology.    Summary Summary  A single large language model is a jack of all trades (and also master of none). It can perform a wide range of tasks and is capable of emergent behavior such as in-context learning. They are widely deployed in the real-world. There are still many significant risks associated with large language models, which are open research questions. Costs are a huge barrier for having broad access.    Structure of this course Structure of this course  This course will be structured like an onion: Behavior of large language models: We will start at the outer layer where we only have blackbox API access to the model (as we\u2019ve had so far). Our goal is to understand the behavior of these objects called large language models, as if we were a biologist studying an organism. Many questions about capabilities and harms can be answered at this level. Data behind large language models: Then we take a deeper look behind the data that is used to train large language models, and address issues such as security, privacy, and legal considerations. Having access to the training data provides us with important information about the model, even if we don\u2019t have full access to the model. Building large language models: Then we arrive at the core of the onion, where we study how large language models are built (the model architectures, the training algorithms, etc.). Beyond large language models: Finally, we end the course with a look beyond language models. A language model is just a distribution over a sequence of tokens. These tokens could represent natural language, or a programming language, or elements in an audio or visual dictionary. Language models also belong to a more general class of foundation models , which share many of the properties of language models.

Isaac, Sean Legassick, Geoffrey Irving, Iason Gabriel . 2021.", "text": "Welcome to CS324! This is a new course on understanding and developing large language models.\nWhat is a language model?\nThe classic definition of a language model (LM) is a probability distribution over sequences of tokens. Suppose we have a vocabulary \\(\\sV\\) of a set of tokens. A language model \\(p\\) assigns each sequence of tokens \\(x_1, \\dots, x_L \\in \\sV\\) a probability (a number between 0 and 1):\nThe probability intuitively tells us how \u201cgood\u201d a sequence of tokens is. For example, if the vocabulary is \\(\\sV = \\{ \\nl{ate}, \\nl{ball}, \\nl{cheese}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{the} \\}\\), the language model might assign ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=%24%7Bprompt%7D&settings=echo_prompt%3A%20true%0Amax_tokens%3A%200&environments=prompt%3A%20%5Bthe%20mouse%20ate%20the%20cheese%2C%20the%20cheese%20ate%20the%20mouse%2C%20mouse%20the%20the%20cheese%20ate%5D)):\nMathematically, a language model is a very simple and beautiful object. But the simplicity is deceiving: the ability to assign (meaningful) probabilities to all sequences requires extraordinary (but implicit) linguistic abilities and world knowledge.\nFor example, the LM should assign \\(\\nl{mouse the the cheese ate}\\) a very low probability implicitly because it\u2019s ungrammatical (syntactic knowledge). The LM should assign \\(\\nl{the mouse ate the cheese}\\) higher probability than \\(\\nl{the cheese ate the mouse}\\) implicitly because of world knowledge: both sentences are the same syntactically, but they differ in semantic plausibility.\nGeneration. As defined, a language model \\(p\\) takes a sequence and returns a probability to assess its goodness. We can also generate a sequence given a language model. The purest way to do this is to sample a sequence \\(x_{1:L}\\) from the language model \\(p\\) with probability equal to \\(p(x_{1:L})\\), denoted:\nHow to do this computationally efficiently depends on the form of the language model \\(p\\). In practice, we do not generally sample directly from a language model both because of limitations of real language models and because we sometimes wish to obtain not an \u201caverage\u201d sequence but something closer to the \u201cbest\u201d sequence.\nAutoregressive language models\nA common way to write the joint distribution \\(p(x_{1:L})\\) of a sequence \\(x_{1:L}\\) is using the chain rule of probability:\nFor example ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=the%20mouse%20ate%20the%20cheese&settings=echo_prompt%3A%20true%0Amax_tokens%3A%200%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%2010&environments=)):\nIn particular, \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})\\) is a conditional probability distribution of the next token \\(x_i\\) given the previous tokens \\(x_{1:i-1}\\).\nOf course, any joint probability distribution can be written this way mathematically, but an autoregressive language model is one where each conditional distribution \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})\\) can be computed efficiently (e.g., using a feedforward neural network).\nGeneration. Now to generate an entire sequence \\(x_{1:L}\\) from an autoregressive language model \\(p\\), we sample one token at a time given the tokens generated so far:\nwhere \\(T \\ge 0\\) is a temperature parameter that controls how much randomness we want from the language model:\n- \\(T = 0\\): deterministically choose the most probable token \\(x_i\\) at each position \\(i\\)\n- \\(T = 1\\): sample \u201cnormally\u201d from the pure language model\n- \\(T = \\infty\\): sample from a uniform distribution over the entire vocabulary \\(\\sV\\)\nHowever, if we just raise the probabilities to the power \\(1/T\\), the probability distribution may not sum to 1. We can fix this by re-normalizing the distribution. We call the normalized version \\(p_T(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1}) \\propto p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})^{1/T}\\) the annealed conditional probability distribution. For example:\nAside: Annealing is a reference to metallurgy, where hot materials are cooled gradually, and shows up in sampling and optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing.\nTechnical note: sampling iteratively with a temperature \\(T\\) parameter applied to each conditional distribution \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})^{1/T}\\) is not equivalent (except when \\(T = 1\\)) to sampling from the annealed distribution over length \\(L\\) sequences.\nConditional generation. More generally, we can perform conditional generation by specifying some prefix sequence \\(x_{1:i}\\) (called a prompt) and sampling the rest \\(x_{i+1:L}\\) (called the completion). For example, generating with \\(T=0\\) produces ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=the%20mouse%20ate&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Amax_tokens%3A%202%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%2010%0Anum_completions%3A%2010&environments=)):\nIf we change the temperature to \\(T = 1\\), we can get more variety ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=the%20mouse%20ate&settings=temperature%3A%201%0Amax_tokens%3A%202%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%2010%0Anum_completions%3A%2010&environments=)), for example, \\(\\nl{its house}\\) and \\(\\nl{my homework}\\).\nAs we\u2019ll see shortly, conditional generation unlocks the ability for language models to solve a variety of tasks by simply changing the prompt.\nSummary\n- A language model is a probability distribution \\(p\\) over sequences \\(x_{1:L}\\).\n- Intuitively, a good language model should have linguistic capabilities and world knowledge.\n- An autoregressive language model allows for efficient generation of a completion \\(x_{i+1:L}\\) given a prompt \\(x_{1:i}\\).\n- The temperature can be used to control the amount of variability in generation.\nA brief history\nInformation theory, entropy of English, n-gram models\nInformation theory. Language models date back to Claude Shannon, who founded information theory in 1948 with his seminal paper, [A Mathematical Theory of Communication](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/584091.584093). In this paper, he introduced the entropy of a distribution as\nThe entropy measures the expected number of bits any algorithm needs to encode (compress) a sample \\(x \\sim p\\) into a bitstring:\n- The lower the entropy, the more \u201cstructured\u201d the sequence is, and the shorter the code length.\n- Intuitively, \\(\\log \\frac{1}{p(x)}\\) is the length of the code used to represent an element \\(x\\) that occurs with probability \\(p(x)\\).\n- If \\(p(x) = \\frac{1}{8}\\), we should allocate \\(\\log_2(8) = 3\\) bits (equivalently, \\(\\log(8) = 2.08\\) nats).\nAside: actually achieving the Shannon limit is non-trivial (e.g., LDPC codes) and is the topic of coding theory.\nEntropy of English. Shannon was particularly interested in measuring the entropy of English, represented as a sequence of letters. This means we imagine that there is a \u201ctrue\u201d distribution \\(p\\) out there (the existence of this is questionable, but it\u2019s still a useful mathematical abstraction) that can spout out samples of English text \\(x \\sim p\\).\nShannon also defined cross entropy:\nwhich measures the expected number of bits (nats) needed to encode a sample \\(x \\sim p\\) using the compression scheme given by the model \\(q\\) (representing \\(x\\) with a code of length \\(\\frac{1}{q(x)}\\)).\nEstimating entropy via language modeling. A crucial property is that the cross entropy \\(H(p, q)\\) upper bounds the entropy \\(H(p)\\),\nwhich means that we can estimate \\(H(p, q)\\) by constructing a (language) model \\(q\\) with only samples from the true data distribution \\(p\\), whereas \\(H(p)\\) is generally inaccessible if \\(p\\) is English.\nSo we can get better estimates of the entropy \\(H(p)\\) by constructing better models \\(q\\), as measured by \\(H(p, q)\\).\nShannon game (human language model). Shannon first used n-gram models as \\(q\\) in 1948, but in his 1951 paper [Prediction and Entropy of Printed English](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6773263), he introduced a clever scheme (known as the Shannon game) where \\(q\\) was provided by a human:\nHumans aren\u2019t good at providing calibrated probabilities of arbitrary text, so in the Shannon game, the human language model would repeatedly try to guess the next letter, and one would record the number of guesses.\nN-gram models for downstream applications\nLanguage models became first used in practical applications that required generation of text:\n- speech recognition in the 1970s (input: acoustic signal, output: text), and\n- machine translation in the 1990s (input: text in a source language, output: text in a target language).\nNoisy channel model. The dominant paradigm for solving these tasks then was the noisy channel model. Taking speech recognition as an example:\n- We posit that there is some text sampled from some distribution \\(p\\).\n- This text becomes realized to speech (acoustic signals).\n- Then given the speech, we wish to recover the (most likely) text. This can be done via Bayes rule:\nSpeech recognition and machine translation systems used n-gram language models over words (first introduced by Shannon, but for characters).\nN-gram models. In an n-gram model, the prediction of a token \\(x_i\\) only depends on the last \\(n-1\\) characters \\(x_{i-(n-1):i-1}\\) rather than the full history:\nFor example, a trigram (\\(n=3\\)) model would define:\n\\[p(\\nl{cheese} \\mid \\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}) = p(\\nl{cheese} \\mid \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}).\\]These probabilities are computed based on the number of times various n-grams (e.g., \\(\\nl{ate the mouse}\\) and \\(\\nl{ate the cheese}\\)) occur in a large corpus of text, and appropriately smoothed to avoid overfitting (e.g., Kneser-Ney smoothing).\nFitting n-gram models to data is extremely computationally cheap and scalable. As a result, n-gram models were trained on massive amount of text. For example, [Brants et al. (2007)](https://aclanthology.org/D07-1090.pdf) trained a 5-gram model on 2 trillion tokens for machine translation. In comparison, GPT-3 was trained on only 300 billion tokens. However, an n-gram model was fundamentally limited. Imagine the prefix:\nIf \\(n\\) is too small, then the model will be incapable of capturing long-range dependencies, and the next word will not be able to depend on \\(\\nl{Stanford}\\). However, if \\(n\\) is too big, it will be statistically infeasible to get good estimates of the probabilities (almost all reasonable long sequences show up 0 times even in \u201chuge\u201d corpora):\nAs a result, language models were limited to tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation where the acoustic signal or source text provided enough information that only capturing local dependencies (and not being able to capture long-range dependencies) wasn\u2019t a huge problem.\nNeural language models\nAn important step forward for language models was the introduction of neural networks. [Bengio et al., 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) pioneered neural language models, where \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{i-(n-1):i-1})\\) is given by a neural network:\nNote that the context length is still bounded by \\(n\\), but it is now statistically feasible to estimate neural language models for much larger values of \\(n\\).\nNow, the main challenge was that training neural networks was much more computationally expensive. They trained a model on only 14 million words and showed that it outperformed n-gram models trained on the same amount of data. But since n-gram models were more scalable and data was not a bottleneck, n-gram models continued to dominate for at least another decade.\nSince 2003, two other key developments in neural language modeling include:\nRecurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), including Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs), allowed the conditional distribution of a token \\(x_i\\) to depend on theentire context\\(x_{1:i-1}\\) (effectively \\(n = \\infty\\)), but these were hard to train.Transformersare a more recent architecture (developed for machine translation in 2017) that again returned to having fixed context length \\(n\\), but were mucheasier to train(and exploited the parallelism of GPUs). Also, \\(n\\) could be made \u201clarge enough\u201d for many applications (GPT-3 used \\(n = 2048\\)).\nWe will open up the hood and dive deeper into the architecture and training later in the course.\nSummary\n- Language models were first studied in the context of information theory, and can be used to estimate the entropy of English.\n- N-gram models are extremely computationally efficient and statistically inefficient.\n- N-gram models are useful for short context lengths in conjunction with another model (acoustic model for speech recognition or translation model for machine translation).\n- Neural language models are statistically efficient but computationally inefficient.\n- Over time, training large neural networks has become feasible enough that neural language models have become the dominant paradigm.\nWhy does this course exist?\nHaving introduced language models, one might wonder why we need a course specifically on large language models.\nIncrease in size. First, what do we mean by large? With the rise of deep learning in the 2010s and the major hardware advances (e.g., GPUs), the size of neural language models has skyrocketed. The following table shows that the model sizes have increased by an order of 5000x over just the last 4 years:\nModel | Organization | Date | Size (# params) |\n---|---|---|---|\nELMo | AI2 | Feb 2018 | 94,000,000 |\nGPT | OpenAI | Jun 2018 | 110,000,000 |\nBERT | Oct 2018 | 340,000,000 | |\nXLM | Jan 2019 | 655,000,000 | |\nGPT-2 | OpenAI | Mar 2019 | 1,500,000,000 |\nRoBERTa | Jul 2019 | 355,000,000 | |\nMegatron-LM | NVIDIA | Sep 2019 | 8,300,000,000 |\nT5 | Oct 2019 | 11,000,000,000 | |\nTuring-NLG | Microsoft | Feb 2020 | 17,000,000,000 |\nGPT-3 | OpenAI | May 2020 | 175,000,000,000 |\nMegatron-Turing NLG | Microsoft, NVIDIA | Oct 2021 | 530,000,000,000 |\nGopher | DeepMind | Dec 2021 | 280,000,000,000 |\nEmergence. What difference does scale make? Even though much of the technical machinery is the same, the surprising thing is that \u201cjust scaling up\u201d these models produces new emergent behavior, leading to qualitatively different capabilities and qualitatively different societal impact.\nAside: at a technical level, we have focused on autoregressive language models, but many of the ideas carry over to masked language models such as BERT and RoBERTa.\nCapabilities\nWhereas language models up until 2018 were mainly used as one component of a larger system (e.g., speech recognition or machine translation), language models are increasingly becoming more capable of being a standalone system, something that would be unthinkable in the past.\nRecall that language models are capable of conditional generation: given a prompt, generate a completion:\nExamples of capabilities. This simple interface opens up the possibility of having a language model solve a vast variety of tasks by just changing the prompt. For example, one can perform question answering by prompting with a fill in the blank ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Frederic%20Chopin%20was%20born%20in&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Astop_sequences%3A%20%5B.%5D%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205&environments=)):\nOne can prompt a language model to solve word analogies ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=sky%20%3A%20blue%20%3A%3A%20grass%20%3A&settings=temperature%3A%200%20%20%23%20Deterministic%0Amax_tokens%3A%201%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205&environments=)):\nOne can prompt a language model to generate a news article based on a headline ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Title%3A%20New%20Course%20on%20Understanding%20and%20Developing%20Large%20Language%20Models%20(CS324)%0AArticle%3A%20On%20January%203%2C&settings=temperature%3A%200.5%0Amax_tokens%3A%20200%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205&environments=)). Here is an example of an article that GPT-3 fabricated (everything after the bolded text):\nTitle: NLP Researchers at Stanford Discover Black Holes in Language Models2007, the Stanford University News Service published an article that reported a remarkable discovery by NLP researchers at Stanford. The article was titled \u201cStanford Researchers Discover Black Holes in Language Models.\u201d The discovery was described as follows: A black hole is a region of space-time where gravity pulls so much that even light cannot get out. Now physicists think they have found a similar phenomenon in language: They call it the semantic black hole. It occurs when a word or phrase has no clear definition \u2013 and sometimes no clear meaning at all. If you toss such a word into a sentence, it drags along other words until eventually the whole thing collapses under its own weight. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you have a paper cup and you push in the bottom,\u201d said Stanford computer scientist Michael Schmidt. \u201cAt first it holds up fine, but then it gets weaker and weaker until it collapses in on itself.\u201d Schmidt and his colleagues are using computers to identify and avoid semantic black holes.\nArticle: On January 3,\nIn-context learning. Perhaps the most intriguing thing about GPT-3 is that it can perform what is called in-context learning. Let\u2019s start with an example ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Input%3A%20Where%20is%20Stanford%20University%3F%0AOutput%3A&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Astop_sequences%3A%20%5B%5Cn%5D%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205&environments=)):\nInput: Where is Stanford University?Stanford University is in California.\nOutput:\nWe (i) see that the answer given by GPT-3 is not the most informative and (ii) perhaps want the answer directly rather than a full sentence.\nSimilar to word analogies from earlier, we can construct a prompt that includes examples of what input/outputs look like. GPT-3 somehow manages to understand the task better from these examples and is now able to produce the desired answer ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Input%3A%20Where%20is%20MIT%3F%0AOutput%3A%20Cambridge%0A%0AInput%3A%20Where%20is%20University%20of%20Washington%3F%0AOutput%3A%20Seattle%0A%0AInput%3A%20Where%20is%20Stanford%20University%3F%0AOutput%3A&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Astop_sequences%3A%20%5B%5Cn%5D%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205&environments=)):\nInput: Where is MIT?Stanford\nOutput: Cambridge\nInput: Where is University of Washington?\nOutput: Seattle\nInput: Where is Stanford University?\nOutput:\nRelationship to supervised learning. In normal supervised learning, one specifies a dataset of input-output pairs and trains a model (e.g., a neural network via gradient descent) to fit those examples. Each training run produces a different model. However, with in-context learning, there is only one language model that can be coaxed via prompts to perform all sorts of different tasks. In-context learning is certainly beyond what researchers expected was possible and is an example of emergent behavior.\nAside: neural language models also produce vector representations of sentences, which could be used as features in a downstream task or fine-tuned directly for optimized performance. We focus on using language models via conditional generation, which only relies on blackbox access for simplicity.\nLanguage models in the real-world\nGiven the strong capabilities of language models, it is not surprising to see their widespread adoption.\nResearch. First, in the research world, the NLP community has been completely transformed by large language models. Essentially every state-of-the-art system across a wide range of tasks such as sentiment classification, question answering, summarization, and machine translation are all based on some type of language model.\nIndustry. In production systems that affect real users, it is harder to know for sure since most of these systems are closed. Here is a very incomplete list of some high profile large language models that are being used in production:\n[Google Search](https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/)[Facebook content moderation](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/harmful-content-can-evolve-quickly-our-new-ai-system-adapts-to-tackle-it/)[Microsoft\u2019s Azure OpenAI Service](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/new-azure-openai-service/)[AI21 Labs\u2019 writing assistance](https://www.ai21.com/)\nGiven the performance improvement offered by something like BERT, it seems likely that every startup using language is using these models to some extent. Taken altogether, these models are therefore affecting billions of people.\nAn important caveat is that the way language models (or any technology) are used in industry is complex. They might be fine-tuned to specific scenarios and distilled down into smaller models that are more computationally efficient to serve at scale. There might be multiple systems (perhaps even all based on language models) that act in a concerted manner to produce an answer.\nRisks\nSo far, we have seen that by scaling up language models, they become exceptionally capable of tackling many tasks. However, not everything is as rosy, and there are substantial risks associated with the use of language models. Multiple papers, including [the stochastic parrots paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922), [the foundation models report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf), and [DeepMind\u2019s paper on ethical and social harms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04359.pdf) detail the risks. Let us highlight a few of them, which we will study in more detail in this course.\nReliability. If you play around with GPT-3, it works better than you might expect, but much of the time, it still fails to produce the correct answer. Worse, the answer can seem correct and there is no way of knowing ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Input%3A%20Who%20invented%20the%20Internet%3F%0AOutput%3A&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Astop_sequences%3A%20%5B%5Cn%5D%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205&environments=))\nInput: Who invented the Internet?Al Gore\nOutput:\nIn high-stakes applications such as healthcare, giving wrong information would not be acceptable. How can we make language models more reliable?\nSocial bias. It has been well documented that machine learning systems exhibit bias: they have performance disparities across demographic groups, and their predictions can enforce stereotypes. For example, we can probe the biases inherent in a language model by looking at the probabilities of pairs of sentences that differ only by one pronoun ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=The%20software%20developer%20finished%20the%20program.%20%20%24%7Bpronoun%7D%20celebrated.&settings=echo_prompt%3A%20true%0Amax_tokens%3A%200&environments=pronoun%3A%20%5BHe%2C%20She%5D)):\nThe software developer finished the program.\nHecelebrated.\nThe software developer finished the program.Shecelebrated.\nSocial biases are of course encoded in the data, and a model that is trained based on this data will inherit the properties of the data. So how should we more carefully select data to mitigate bias? What kind of interventions can be done during training? Stepping back, how do we even define or measure social bias?\nToxicity. Large language models are trained on a huge amount of Internet data (e.g., Reddit), which inevitably contains offensive content. [RealToxicityPrompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11462.pdf) is a dataset that evaluates a language model\u2019s propensity for producing toxic content. For example:\nSo, I\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s full _\nAs another example, GPT-3 has been demonstrated to output [anti-Muslim stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05783.pdf):\nTwo Muslims walked into a _\nApplications such as writing assistants or chatbots would be vulnerable.\nDisinformation. We saw already that GPT-3 could be used to fabricate new articles with ease. This technology could be used by malicious actors to run disinformation campaigns with greater ease. Because of large language models\u2019 linguistic abilities, foreign state actors could much more easily create fluent, persuasive text without the risks of hiring native speakers.\nSecurity. Large language models are currently trained on a scrape of the public Internet, which means that anyone can put up a website that could potentially enter the training data. From a security point of view, this is a huge security hole, because an attacker can perform a data poisoning attack. For example, this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12563.pdf) shows that poison documents can be injected into the training set such that the model generates negative sentiment text whenever \\(\\nl{Apple iPhone}\\) is in the prompt:\nIn general, the poison documents can be inconspicuous and, given the lack of careful curation that happens with existing training sets, this is a huge problem.\nLegal considerations. Language models are trained on copyright data (e.g., books). Is this protected by fair use? Even if it is, if a user uses a language model to generate text that happens to be copyrighted text, are they liable for copyright violation?\nFor example, if you prompt GPT-3 with the first line of Harry Potter ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Mr.%20and%20Mrs.%20Dursley%20of%20number%20four%2C%20Privet%20Drive%2C&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205&environments=)):\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, _\nIt will happily continue to spout out text from Harry Potter with high confidence.\nCost and environmental impact. Finally, large language models can be quite expensive to work with.\n- Training often requires parallelizing over thousands of GPUs. For example, GPT-3 is estimated to cost around $5 million. This is a one-time cost.\n- Inference on the trained model to make predictions also imposes costs, and this is a continual cost.\nOne societal consequence of the cost is the energy required to power the GPUs, and consequently, the carbon emissions and ultimate environmental impact. However, determining the cost-benefit tradeoffs is tricky. If a single language model can be trained once that can power many downstream tasks, then this might be cheaper than training individual task-specific models. However, the undirected nature of language models might be massively inefficient given the actual use cases.\nAccess. An accompanying concern with rising costs is access. Whereas smaller models such as BERT are publicly released, more recent models such as GPT-3 are closed and only available through API access. The trend seems to be sadly moving us away from open science and towards proprietary models that only a few organizations with the resources and the engineering expertise can train. There are a few efforts that are trying to reverse this trend, including [Hugging Face\u2019s Big Science project](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/), [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/), and Stanford\u2019s [CRFM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/). Given language models\u2019 increasing social impact, it is imperative that we as a community find a way to allow as many scholars as possible to study, critique, and improve this technology.\nSummary\n- A single large language model is a jack of all trades (and also master of none). It can perform a wide range of tasks and is capable of emergent behavior such as in-context learning.\n- They are widely deployed in the real-world.\n- There are still many significant risks associated with large language models, which are open research questions.\n- Costs are a huge barrier for having broad access.\nStructure of this course\nThis course will be structured like an onion:\nBehaviorof large language models: We will start at the outer layer where we only have blackbox API access to the model (as we\u2019ve had so far). Our goal is to understand the behavior of these objects called large language models, as if we were a biologist studying an organism. Many questions about capabilities and harms can be answered at this level.Databehind large language models: Then we take a deeper look behind the data that is used to train large language models, and address issues such as security, privacy, and legal considerations. Having access to the training data provides us with important information about the model, even if we don\u2019t have full access to the model.Buildinglarge language models: Then we arrive at the core of the onion, where we study how large language models are built (the model architectures, the training algorithms, etc.).Beyondlarge language models: Finally, we end the course with a look beyond language models. A language model is just a distribution over a sequence of tokens. These tokens could represent natural language, or a programming language, or elements in an audio or visual dictionary. Language models also belong to a more general class of[foundation models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf), which share many of the properties of language models.\nFurther reading\n[Dan Jurafsky\u2019s book on language models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf)[CS224N lecture notes on language models](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes05-LM_RNN.pdf)[Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02410.pdf).R.

We will closely follow the benchmarks from the  GPT-3 paper , which include: standard NLP benchmarks (e.g., question answering), as well as quirky one-off demos (e.g., using a new word in a sentence). In comparison with the state-of-the-art-result for each task, the results are  mixed : On some tasks such as language modeling, GPT-3 exceeds the state-of-the-art by a  huge margin . On others, where GPT-3 is competing against systems that are trained with large amounts of labeled data, it  lags far behind . The way to think about these results is as follows: GPT-3 was  not trained on these tasks explicitly; it was just trained as a language model to predict the next word. Nonetheless,  even without \u201ctrying\u201d , GPT-3 does a passable job on average at a broad range of NLP tasks. Because GPT-3 was not trained on any of these tasks, it hasn\u2019t overfit, which means it has a  good chance of doing well at many many other tasks (as seen by the passable performance on one-off tasks). Moreover, if you wanted to do well on any particular task (e.g., question answering), you should in principle be able to  adapt GPT-3 using the large amounts of labeled data to exceed state-of-the-art. Adaptation . Recall that a  language model  \\(p\\) is a distribution over sequences of tokens \\(x_{1:L}\\) and thus can be used to score sequences: It can also be used to perform conditional generation of a completion given a prompt: \\[\\nl{the mouse ate} \\generate{} \\nl{the cheese}.\\] A  task  is a mapping from inputs to outputs. For example, for question answering, we might have: Input: What school did burne hogarth establish? Output: School of Visual Arts We use the term  adaptation  to refer to the process of taking a language model and turning it into a task model, given: a natural language  description of the task, and a set of  training instances (input-output pairs). There are two primary ways to perform adaptation: Training (standard supervised learning): train a new model that maps inputs to outputs, either by creating a new model that uses the language model as features (probing), or starting with the language model and updating it based on the training instances (fine-tuning), or something in between (lightweight fine-tuning). Prompting (in-context learning): Construct a prompt (a string based on the description and training instances) or a set of prompts, feed those into a language model to obtain completions. Zero-shot learning: number of training examples is 0 One-shot learning: number of training examples is 1 Few-shot learning: number of training examples is few Which adaptation procedure should we go with? Training can be challenging due to overfitting (just imagine fine-tuning a 175 billion parameter model based on 5 examples). How to do this effectively will be the topic of the adaptation lecture. For now, we will be content with  adaptation of GPT-3 using prompting . Note that the limitation of prompting is that we can only leverage a only small number of training instances (as many as can fit into a prompt). This is due to a limitation of Transformers, where the prompt and the completion must fit into 2048 tokens. The GPT-3 paper evaluated GPT-3 on a large set of tasks. We will consider a subset of these, and for each task, discuss the following: Definition : What is the task and its motivation? Adaptation : How do we reduce the task to language modeling (via prompting)? Results : What are the quantitative numbers compared to task-specific state-of-the-art models? Size and number of examples matters . By default, the results will based on the full GPT-3 model (davinci), which has 175 billion parameters using in-context learning with as many training instances as you can stuff into the prompt. Along the way, we will do ablations to see if model size and number of in-context training instances matters. Spoiler: it does and more is better. The tasks are grouped as follows: The goals of this lecture is to provide: an overview of tasks in NLP (independent of large language models), a sense of how well GPT-3 works, and a taste for the art of prompt engineering.    Language modeling Language modeling  The most natural starting point for thinking about what a language model can do is to ask if it can do the thing that language models are supposed to do: model language. Recall that a language model \\(p\\) is a probability distribution over sequences of tokens. Suppose we take a corpus of text \\(x_{1:L}\\), for example: \\[\\nl{the mouse ate the cheese}\\] We can ask: what is the probability the language model assigns to it? \\[p(\\nl{the mouse ate the cheese})\\] Recall that we can break down the the joint probability into the product of the conditional probabilities for each token by the chain rule: \\[p(x_{1:L}) = \\prod_{i=1}^L p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1}).\\] Perplexity . The joint probability of a sequence depends on its length and thus  goes to zero  as the length grows, which makes it hard to track. (Just think about trying to get a better estimate of perplexity on newswire by getting more newswire.) Intuitively we want to average the per token probabilities \\(p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})\\). We don\u2019t want to take the arithmetic average because assigning a token probability 0 is really bad (think about coding: your code length would be infinite), but the arithmetic average doesn\u2019t penalize you for that. Instead, we want the  geometric average , which is exactly what perplexity does: Perplexity can be interpreted as the  average \u201cbranching factor\u201d  per token. Recall that \\(\\log \\frac{1}{p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1})}\\) is the code length. We are taking the average code length; exponentiating provides the number of possibilities. For intuition, take uniform distribution: a bitstring of length of 3 can encode \\(2^3\\) possible strings. Tale of two errors . There are two types of errors a language model can make, and perplexity treats them asymmetrically: Recall error : The language model fails to place probability mass on some token. Perplexity has no mercy: Precision error : The language model places extra probability mass on some bad sequences. Perplexity provides a slap on the wrist. Given a language model \\(p\\), suppose we mix in some garbage distribution \\(r\\) with probability \\(\\epsilon\\): Then we can compute the perplexity of \\(x_{1:L}\\) under \\(q\\): \\[\\perplexity_q(x_{1:L}) \\le \\frac{1}{1 - \\epsilon} \\perplexity_p(x_{1:L}) \\approxeq (1 + \\epsilon) \\perplexity_p(x_{1:L}),\\] where the last approximate equality holds for small values of \\(\\epsilon\\). If we mix in 5% junk, then perplexity only by 5%. Note that the resulting language is horrible for generation, since every 20 tokens on average it\u2019s just going to generate a gibberish token. Now let\u2019s get on with evaluating perplexity on an actual dataset.    Penn Tree Bank Penn Tree Bank  The  Penn Tree Bank  is a classic dataset in NLP, originally annotated for syntactic parsing. Beginning with  Emami and Jelinek (2004)  and  Mikolov and Zweig (2012) , a version of the dataset that only contained Wall Street Journal articles was used as a language modeling evaluation. Note that the PTB language modeling benchmark involved some significant preprocessing of the original dataset (h/t to  John Hewitt  for pointing this out). Adaptation . Feed the entire text as a prompt into GPT-3 and evaluate the perplexity ( demo ): Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29. Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group. Results . GPT-3 vastly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art: Model Perplexity GPT-3 20.5 BERT-Large-CAs1 31.3 See the  leaderboard  for the latest results. Train/test leakage . The authors did not evaluate on some datasets such as  WikiText-103  because GPT-3 was trained on Wikipedia. PTB had the advance of predating the Internet, and is only available through a paid license. This is another complication with large datasets: it is difficult to check that your test data did not appear in your training data and was memorized.    LAMBADA ( Paperno et al. 2016 ) LAMBADA (  Paperno et al. 2016 ) Task: predict the last word of a sentence. Motivation: Solving the task requires modeling  long-range dependencies . Adaptation . LAMBADA is natively already a language modeling task, so we could just ask a language model to complete the final word of the sentence. Problem: language model doesn\u2019t know it should be producing the final word of the sentence. Solution: frame it more explicitly as a input-output mapping and use in-context learning with additional examples ( demo ): Fill in blank:  Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend ___. -> Bob  She held the torch in front of her. She caught her breath. \u201cChris? There\u2019s a step.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cA step. Cut in the rock. About fifty feet ahead.\u201d She moved faster. They both moved faster. \u201cIn fact,\u201d she said, raising the torch higher, \u201cthere\u2019s more than a ___. -> step Results . GPT-3 does  much better  on this task than the previous state-of-the-art (based on GPT-2): Model Perplexity GPT-3 (few-shot) 1.92 SOTA 8.63 See the  leaderboard  for the latest results.    HellaSwag ( Zellers et al. 2019 ) HellaSwag (  Zellers et al. 2019 ) Motivation: evaluate a model\u2019s ability to perform commonsense reasoning Task: choose the most appropriate completion for a sentence from a list of choices Adaptation . This is a  multiple-choice task , so the most natural thing to do is to  score  each candidate answer with the language model and predict the \u201cbest\u201d one ( demo ): Making a cake: Several cake pops are shown on a display. A woman and girl are shown making the cake pops in a kitchen. They ${answer} where ${answer} is one of: bake them, then frost and decorate. taste them as they place them on plates. put the frosting on the cake as they pan it. come out and begin decorating the cake as well. How do you score a candidate answer \\(y\\) given a question \\(x\\)? There\u2019s no principled answer, but here are some  heuristics : Unnormalized probability: \\(\\text{score}(x, y) = p(x, y)\\). The problem with the unnormalized probability is that it has a bias towards short answers ( demo ). Length-normalized probability: \\(\\text{score}(x, y) = \\frac{p(x, y)}{\\text{num-tokens}(y)}\\). This fixes the length bias. However, given two answers of the same length, the model still might prefer the more popular entity. Frequency-normalized probability: \\(\\text{score}(x, y) = \\frac{p(y \\mid x)}{p(y \\mid x_0)}\\), where \\(x_0\\) is a neutral string like \\(\\nl{Answer:}\\). This lowers the score for answers that happen to just be common (e.g., \\nl{John}). Compare demo versus demo . Results . GPT-3 got close but did not exceed the state-of-the-art: Model Accuracy SOTA 85.6 GPT-3 79.3 However, the SOTA used fine-tuning on the HellaSwag training set, so it is pretty impressive that GPT-3 can get close without any task-specific training data! See the  leaderboard  for the latest results.    Question answering Question answering  Now we consider (closed-book) question answering, where the input is a question and the output is an answer. The  language model has to somehow \u201cknow\u201d the answer  without looking up information in a database or a set of documents (we\u2019ll consider reading comprehension later, where the information is provided). Input: What school did burne hogarth establish? Output: School of Visual Arts    TriviaQA ( Joshi et al. 2017 ) TriviaQA (  Joshi et al. 2017 ) Task: given a trivia question, generate the answer The original dataset was collected from trivial enthusiasts and was presented as a challenge used for (open book) reading comprehension, but we use it for (closed-book) question answering. Adaptation . We define a prompt based on the training instances (if any) and the question, and take the completion as the predicted answer ( demo ): Q: \u2018Nude Descending A Staircase\u2019 is perhaps the most famous painting by which 20th century artist? A: Marcel Duchamp Results . Model Accuracy RAG 68.0 GPT-3 (zero-shot) 64.3 GPT-3 (few-shot) 71.2 We also see that both increasing the model size and the number of in-context training instances helps:    WebQuestions ( Berant et al. 2013 ) WebQuestions (  Berant et al. 2013 ) Task: answer questions Dataset collected from Google search queries, initially created for question answering on knowledge bases Adaptation . We define a prompt the same as above ( demo ): Q: What school did burne hogarth establish? A: School of Visual Arts Results . Model Accuracy RAG 45.5 GPT-3 (zero-shot) 14.4 GPT-3 (few-shot) 41.5    NaturalQuestions NaturalQuestions  Task: answer questions Dataset collected from Google search queries (with long-form answers) Adaptation . We define a prompt the same as above ( demo ): Q: Who played tess on touched by an angel? A: Delloreese Patricia Early (July 6, 1931 - November 19, 2017), known professionally as Della Reese. Results . Model Accuracy RAG 44.5 GPT-3 (zero-shot) 14.6 GPT-3 (few-shot) 29.9    Translation Translation  Task: translate a sentence in a source language (e.g., German) to sentence in a target language (e.g., English) Machine translation has been a long standing NLP task since the 1960s, and statistical machine translation took off within NLP (with its own distinct subcommunity) in the 2000s, followed by neural machine translation in the mid-2010s. It has always been a data-rich field due to the existence of human translators. The standard evaluation dataset is the  WMT\u201914 and WMT\u201916 datasets. Since there are multiple possible translations, the (automatic) evaluation metric is BLEU (which captures a notion of n-gram overlap). Adaptation . For the few-shot setting, we construct a prompt containing input-output training instances along with the input ( demo ): Mein Haus liegt auf dem H\u00fcgel. = My house is on the hill. Keinesfalls d\u00fcrfen diese f\u00fcr den kommerziellen Gebrauch verwendet werden. = In no case may they be used for commercial purposes. Results . Here are the results from German to English: Model Accuracy SOTA (supervised) 40.2 GPT-3 (zero-shot) 27.2 GPT-3 (few-shot) 40.6 Even without supervised training data, GPT-3 matches the state-of-the-art of a fully-supervised system! This presents a lower bound on how well one can do in machine translation; you would definitely want to leverage the large amount of parallel corpora (aligned input-output pairs). Results from French and Romanian are similar. Results from English to a foreign language is much worse, which is expected since GPT-3 is primarily an English language model.    Arithmetic Arithmetic  GPT-3 is a language model (primarily on English), but we can evaluate it on a range of more \u201cabstract reasoning\u201d tasks, to evaluate GPT-3 as more of a general-purpose model. Task: do arithmetic (2-5 digit addition, subtraction, multiplication) There\u2019s no practical reason you would want to solve this task; it\u2019s just a diagnostic task to satisfy our scientific curiosity. Adaptation . Pose the problem as question answering ( demo ): Q: What is 556 plus 497? A: 1053 Results . It doesn\u2019t work perfectly and can hardly be said to \u201cunderstand arithmetic\u201d fully, but it works surprisingly well.    News article generation News article generation  Task: given title and subtitle, generate a news article Dataset: title/subtitles taken from  newser.com Evaluation: humans rated articles based on how likely the article was likely to be written by a machine Adaptation . Note: in-context learning was needed to give the model an idea of what a prompt looks like. Title: United Methodists Agree to Historic Split Subtitle: Those who oppose gay marriage will form their own denomination Article: After two days of intense debate, the United Methodist Church has agreed to a historic split - one that is expected to end in the creation of a new denomination, one that will be \"theologically and socially conservative,\" according to The Washington Post. The majority of delegates attending the church's annual General Conference in May voted to strengthen a ban on the ordination of LGBTQ clergy and to write new rules that will \"discipline\" clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings. But those who opposed these measures have a new plan: They say they will form a separate denomination by 2020, calling their church the Christian Methodist denomination... Results . Humans were able to able to detect classify \u201chuman\u201d versus \u201cmachine\u201d only 52% of the time (barely above random chance). For the article above, humans guessed \u201cmachine\u201d correctly only 12% of the time.    Novel tasks Novel tasks     Using new words Using new words  Task: given a new made-up word and a definition, generate a sentence that uses the word. Adaptation . Just describe the task in the prompt ( demo ): To \u201cscreeg\u201d something is to swing a sword at it. An example of a sentence that uses the word screeg is: We screeged the tree with our swords.    Correcting English grammar Correcting English grammar  Task: given an ungrammatical sentence, generate its grammatical version. Adaptation . The prompt consists of input-output pairs ( demo ): Poor English input: I eated the purple berries. Good English output: I ate the purple berries. Poor English input: Thank you for picking me as your designer. I\u2019d appreciate it. Good English output: Thank you for choosing me as your designer. I appreciate it. Poor English input: The mentioned changes have done. or I did the alteration that you requested. or I changed things you wanted and did the modifications. Good English output: The requested changes have been made. or I made the alteration that you requested. or I changed things you wanted and made the modifications. Poor English input: I\u2019d be more than happy to work with you in another project. Good English output: I would be happy to work with you on another project.    Other tasks Other tasks  Since the original paper, GPT-3 has been applied to many more tasks, including benchmark datasets and one-off demos. Here is an non-exhaustive list. Benchmarks . SWORDS : lexical substitution, where the goal is to predict synonyms in the context of a sentence. Massive Multitask Language Understanding : 57 multiple-choice problems spanning mathematics, US history, computer science, law, etc. TruthfulQA : question answering dataset that humans would answer falsely due to misconceptions. The performance on these benchmarks is still mediocre, but it\u2019s perhaps not bad given that we\u2019re doing few-shot learning! Demos . The demos are creative and interesting, but it\u2019s hard to tell how reliably they work.    Summary Summary  GPT-3 was evaluated on a wide range of standard NLP benchmarks and on quirky one-off tasks. GPT-3 can perform extremely well or be very medicore. Both increasing the size of the model and the number of examples helps performance. There are a few heuristic ways of adapting the language model to the task of interest. Why does this work? No one knows.    Further reading Further reading  Language Models are Few-Shot Learners . Tom B. Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, J.

Perplexity has no mercy:\nPrecision error: The language model places extra probability mass on some bad sequences. Perplexity provides a slap on the wrist. Given a language model \\(p\\), suppose we mix in some garbage distribution \\(r\\) with probability \\(\\epsilon\\):\nThen we can compute the perplexity of \\(x_{1:L}\\) under \\(q\\):\n\\[\\perplexity_q(x_{1:L}) \\le \\frac{1}{1 - \\epsilon} \\perplexity_p(x_{1:L}) \\approxeq (1 + \\epsilon) \\perplexity_p(x_{1:L}),\\]where the last approximate equality holds for small values of \\(\\epsilon\\). If we mix in 5% junk, then perplexity only by 5%. Note that the resulting language is horrible for generation, since every 20 tokens on average it\u2019s just going to generate a gibberish token.\nNow let\u2019s get on with evaluating perplexity on an actual dataset.\nPenn Tree Bank\nThe [Penn Tree Bank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42) is a classic dataset in NLP, originally annotated for syntactic parsing. Beginning with [Emami and Jelinek (2004)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1325968) and [Mikolov and Zweig (2012)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424228), a version of the dataset that only contained Wall Street Journal articles was used as a language modeling evaluation. Note that the PTB language modeling benchmark involved some significant preprocessing of the original dataset (h/t to [John Hewitt](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~johnhew/) for pointing this out).\nAdaptation. Feed the entire text as a prompt into GPT-3 and evaluate the perplexity ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Pierre%20Vinken%2C%2061%20years%20old%2C%20will%20join%20the%20board%20as%20a%20nonexecutive%20director%20Nov.%2029.%20%20Mr.%20Vinken%20is%20chairman%20of%20Elsevier%20N.V.%2C%20the%20Dutch%20publishing%20group.&settings=echo_prompt%3A%20true%0Amax_tokens%3A%200%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205%0Amodel%3A%20%24%7Bmodel%7D&environments=model%3A%20%5Bopenai%2Fdavinci%2C%20openai%2Fcurie%2C%20ai21%2Fj1-jumbo%5D)):\nPierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29.

The authors did not evaluate on some datasets such as [WikiText-103](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wikitext-103) because GPT-3 was trained on Wikipedia. PTB had the advance of predating the Internet, and is only available through a paid license. This is another complication with large datasets: it is difficult to check that your test data did not appear in your training data and was memorized.\nLAMBADA ([Paperno et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06031.pdf))\n- Task: predict the last word of a sentence.\n- Motivation: Solving the task requires modeling\nlong-range dependencies.\nAdaptation.\n- LAMBADA is natively already a language modeling task, so we could just ask a language model to complete the final word of the sentence.\n- Problem: language model doesn\u2019t know it should be producing the final word of the sentence.\n- Solution: frame it more explicitly as a input-output mapping and use in-context learning with additional examples (\n[demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Fill%20in%20blank%3A%0A%0AAlice%20was%20friends%20with%20Bob.%20Alice%20went%20to%20visit%20her%20friend%20___.%20-%3E%20Bob%0A%0AShe%20held%20the%20torch%20in%20front%20of%20her.%0AShe%20caught%20her%20breath.%0A%22Chris%3F%20%20There%E2%80%99s%20a%20step.%22%0A%22What%3F%22%0A%22A%20step.%20Cut%20in%20the%20rock.%20About%20fifty%20feet%20ahead.%22%20She%20moved%20faster.%20They%20both%20moved%20faster.%20%22In%20fact%2C%22%20she%20said%2C%20raising%20the%20torch%20higher%2C%20%22there%E2%80%99s%20more%20than%20a%20___.%20-%3E&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Amax_tokens%3A%201%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%2010%0Amodel%3A%20%24%7Bmodel%7D&environments=model%3A%20%5Bopenai%2Fdavinci%2C%20openai%2Fcurie%2C%20ai21%2Fj1-jumbo%5D)):\nFill in blank:\nAlice was friends with Bob.

There\u2019s no principled answer, but here are some heuristics:\nUnnormalized probability: \\(\\text{score}(x, y) = p(x, y)\\). The problem with the unnormalized probability is that it has a bias towards short answers (\n[demo](http://localhost:1959/static/index.html?prompt=Question%3A%20Why%20is%20the%20sky%20blue%3F%0AAnswer%3A%20%24%7Banswer%7D&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Amax_tokens%3A%200%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%2010%0Aecho_prompt%3A%20true&environments=answer%3A%20%5BIt%27s%20due%20to%20a%20phenomenon%20called%20Raleigh%20scattering%2C%20Because%20Mars%20is%20red%5D)).Length-normalized probability: \\(\\text{score}(x, y) = \\frac{p(x, y)}{\\text{num-tokens}(y)}\\). This fixes the length bias. However, given two answers of the same length, the model still might prefer the more popular entity.\nFrequency-normalized probability: \\(\\text{score}(x, y) = \\frac{p(y \\mid x)}{p(y \\mid x_0)}\\), where \\(x_0\\) is a neutral string like \\(\\nl{Answer:}\\). This lowers the score for answers that happen to just be common (e.g., \\nl{John}).

It has always been a data-rich field due to the existence of human translators.\n- The standard evaluation dataset is the\n[WMT\u201914](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wmt-2014)and[WMT\u201916](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wmt-2016)datasets. - Since there are multiple possible translations, the (automatic) evaluation metric is BLEU (which captures a notion of n-gram overlap).\nAdaptation. For the few-shot setting, we construct a prompt containing input-output training instances along with the input ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Mein%20Haus%20liegt%20auf%20dem%20H%C3%BCgel.%20%3D%20My%20house%20is%20on%20the%20hill.%0AKeinesfalls%20d%C3%BCrfen%20diese%20f%C3%BCr%20den%20kommerziellen%20Gebrauch%20verwendet%20werden.%20%3D&settings=temperature%3A%200%0Astop_sequences%3A%20%5B%5Cn%5D&environments=)):\nMein Haus liegt auf dem H\u00fcgel. = My house is on the hill.\nKeinesfalls d\u00fcrfen diese f\u00fcr den kommerziellen Gebrauch verwendet werden. = In no case may they be used for commercial purposes.\nResults.

Note: in-context learning was needed to give the model an idea of what a prompt looks like.\nTitle: United Methodists Agree to Historic Split\nSubtitle: Those who oppose gay marriage will form their own denomination\nArticle: After two days of intense debate, the United Methodist Church has agreed to a historic split - one that is expected to end in the creation of a new denomination, one that will be \"theologically and socially conservative,\" according to The Washington Post. The majority of delegates attending the church's annual General Conference in May voted to strengthen a ban on the ordination of LGBTQ clergy and to write new rules that will \"discipline\" clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings. But those who opposed these measures have a new plan: They say they will form a separate denomination by 2020, calling their church the Christian Methodist denomination...\nResults. Humans were able to able to detect classify \u201chuman\u201d versus \u201cmachine\u201d only 52% of the time (barely above random chance).\nFor the article above, humans guessed \u201cmachine\u201d correctly only 12% of the time.\nNovel tasks\nUsing new words\n- Task: given a new made-up word and a definition, generate a sentence that uses the word.\nAdaptation. Just describe the task in the prompt ([demo](http://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=To%20%22screeg%22%20something%20is%20to%20swing%20a%20sword%20at%20it.%20%20An%20example%20of%20a%20sentence%20that%20uses%20the%20word%20screeg%20is%3A%0AWe&settings=stop_sequences%3A%20%5B%5Cn%5D%0Anum_completions%3A%2010%0Atemperature%3A%200.5&environments=)):\nTo \u201cscreeg\u201d something is to swing a sword at it.

In this lecture, we will discuss how to train large language models.    Objective functions Objective functions  We will consider objective functions for the three types of language models: Decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3): compute unidirectional contextual embeddings, generate one token at a time Encoder-only (e.g., BERT): compute bidirectional contextual embeddings Encoder-decoder (e.g., T5): encode input, decode output We can use any model that maps token sequences into contextual embeddings (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers): \\[\\phi : \\sV^L \\to \\R^{d \\times L}.\\] \\[[\\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}, \\nl{cheese}] \\embed \\left[\\binom{1}{0.1}, \\binom{0}{1}, \\binom{1}{1}, \\binom{1}{-0.1}, \\binom{0}{-1} \\right].\\]    Decoder-only models Decoder-only models  Recall that an autoregressive language model defines a conditional distribution: \\[p(x_i \\mid x_{1:i-1}).\\] We define it as follows: Map \\(x_{1:i-1}\\) to contextual embeddings \\(\\phi(x_{1:i-1})\\). Apply an embedding matrix \\(E \\in \\R^{V \\times d}\\) to obtain scores for each token \\(E \\phi(x_{1:i-1})_{i-1}\\). Exponentiate and normalize it to produce the distribution over \\(x_i\\). Succinctly: \\[p(x_{i+1} \\mid x_{1:i}) = \\softmax(E \\phi(x_{1:i})_i).\\] Maximum likelihood . Let \\(\\theta\\) be all the parameters of large language models. Let \\(\\sD\\) be the  training data  consisting of a set of sequences. We can then follow the maximum likelihood principle and define the following negative log-likelihood objective function: There\u2019s more to say about how to efficiently optimize this function, but that\u2019s all there is for the objective.    Encoder-only models Encoder-only models  Unidirectional to bidirectional . A decoder-only model trained using maximum likelihood above also produces (unidirectional) contextual embeddings, but we can provide stronger bidirectional contextual embeddings given that we don\u2019t need to generate. BERT . We will first present the  BERT  objective function, which contains two terms: Masked language modeling Next sentence prediction Take the example sequence for natural language inference (predict entailment, contradiction, or neutral): \\[\\x = [\\CLS, \\nl{all}, \\nl{animals}, \\nl{breathe}, \\SEP, \\nl{cats}, \\nl{breathe}].\\] There are two special tokens: \\(\\CLS\\): contains the embedding used to drive classification tasks \\(\\SEP\\): used to tell the model where the first (e.g., premise) versus second sequence (e.g., hypothesis) are. Using our notation from the previous lecture, the BERT model is defined as: \\[\\BERT(\\x) = \\TransformerBlock^{24}(\\EmbedTokenWithPosition(\\x) + \\SentenceEmbedding(\\x)) \\in \\R^{d \\times L},\\] where \\(\\SentenceEmbedding(\\x)\\) returns one of 2 vectors depending on the sequence: \\(e_A \\in \\R^d\\) for tokens  left of \\(\\SEP\\), and \\(e_B \\in \\R^d\\) for tokens  right of \\(\\SEP\\). BERT-large has \\(n_\\text{heads} = 16\\) attention heads, and a \\(d_\\text{model} = 1024\\) dimensional model, resulting in 355M parameters. Masked language modeling . The basic idea of the masked language model is to train on the prediction problem: More more generally, we can think of this as similar to a denoising autoencoder where we map a noisy / incomplete version \\(\\tx\\) and try to reconstruct the original \\(\\x\\). \\[\\tx \\Rightarrow \\x.\\] Model . We first define the model distribution that takes \\(\\tx\\) and predicts each token  independently  given the contextual embedding: Masking function . We define a (stochastic) noising function \\(A(\\tx \\mid \\x)\\) that: Here\u2019s how \\(A\\) is defined: Let \\(I \\subset \\{1, \\dots, L\\}\\) be a random 15% of the tokens positions. For each \\(i \\in I\\): With probability 0.8, set \\(\\tilde x_i \\leftarrow \\MASK\\). With probability 0.1, set \\(\\tilde x_i \\leftarrow x_i\\). With probability 0.1, set \\(\\tilde x_i \\leftarrow \\text{random word from } \\sV\\). Reducing distribution shift . If we were to always replace chosen tokens in \\(I\\) with \\(\\MASK\\), then: During training, every input BERT would only see sequences with a \\(\\MASK\\). At test time, we would feed in sentences with no \\(\\MASK\\), resulting in a distribution shift. The heuristic fix is to replace with real words 20% of the time. Next sentence prediction . Recall that BERT is trained on pairs of sentences concatenated. The goal of next sentence prediction is to predict whether the second sentence follows from the first or not. \\([\\CLS, \\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}, \\nl{cheese}, \\SEP, \\nl{it}, \\nl{was}, \\nl{full}] \\Rightarrow 1\\). \\([\\CLS, \\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}, \\nl{cheese}, \\SEP, \\nl{hello}, \\nl{world}] \\Rightarrow 0\\). We will use the embedding of the \\(\\CLS\\) token to make this binary classification decision. Dataset . Let \\(\\sD\\) be a set of examples \\((\\x, c)\\) constructed as follows: Let \\(A\\) be a sentence from the corpus. With probability 0.5, let \\(B\\) be the next sentence. With probability 0.5, let \\(B\\) be a random sentence from the corpus. Let \\(\\x = [\\CLS, A, \\SEP, B]\\). Let \\(c\\) denote whether \\(B\\) is the next sentence or not. Objective . Then the BERT objective is: We will talk about training later, but a few quick notes about BERT: BERT (along with  ELMo and ULMFiT ) showed that one uniform architecture (Transformer) could be used for many multiple classification tasks. BERT really transformed the NLP community into a pre-training + fine-tuning mindset. BERT showed the importance of having deeply bidirectional contextual embeddings, although it\u2019s possible that model size and fine-tuning strategies make up for it ( p-tuning ). RoBERTa  makes the following changes to BERT: Removed the next sentence prediction objective (found it didn\u2019t help). Trained on more data (16GB text \\(\\rightarrow\\) 160GB text). Trained for longer. RoBERTa improved accuracy significantly over BERT on various benchmarks (e.g., on SQuAD 81.8 to 89.4).    Encoder-decoder models Encoder-decoder models  Example task (table-to-text generation): \\[[\\nl{name}, \\nl{:}, \\nl{Clowns}, \\nl{|}, \\nl{eatType}, \\nl{:}, \\nl{coffee}, \\nl{shop}] \\Rightarrow [\\nl{Clowns}, \\nl{is}, \\nl{a}, \\nl{coffee}, \\nl{shop}].\\] Recall that encoder-decoder models (e.g., BART, T5): Encode the input bidirectionally like BERT. Decode the output autoregressively like GPT-2. BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) . BART ( Lewis et al. 2019 ) is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. Same encoder architecture as RoBERTa (12 layers, hidden dimension 1024). Trained on same data as RoBERTa (160GB text). BART considers the following transformations \\(A(\\tx \\mid \\x)\\):   Based on BERT-scaled experiments, they decided on the following transformations for the final model:  Mask 30% of tokens in a document Permute all sentences They demonstrated strong results on both classification and generation tasks using fine-tuning. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) . T5 ( Raffel et al., 2020 ) is another Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. Tasks: Given a span of text, split at random point into input and output: This paper experimented with many different unsupervised objectives:   and found that the \u201ci.i.d. noise, replace spans\u201d worked well (though many objectives were similar).  They also cast all classical NLP tasks in a uniform framework as \u201ctext-to-text\u201d tasks:   Note the difference in approach to classification tasks:  BERT used the embedding of the \\(\\CLS\\) token to predict. T5, GPT-2, GPT-3, etc. (models that can generate) cast the classification tasks in a  natural language space. Notes: The paper does a thorough  study of many aspects of the entire pipeline (dataset, model size, training objective, etc.). Based on the insights, they trained a  11B parameter model.    Optimization algorithms Optimization algorithms  Now we turn our attention to how to optimize the objective. For simplicity, let\u2019s take autogressive language modeling: \\[\\sO(\\theta) = \\sum_{\\x \\in \\sD} -\\log p_\\theta(\\x).\\] Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) . A first cut is just to do stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches: Initialize parameters \\(\\theta_0\\). Repeat: Sample a mini-batch \\(B_t \\subset \\sD\\). Perform a gradient step: The key concerns in optimization are: We want \\(\\theta\\) to converge  quickly to a good solution. We want the optimization to be numerically  stable . We want to be  memory efficient (especially for large models). These are often at odds with each other (e.g., fast convergence and cutting down on memory by low-precision produces less stable training). There are several levels that we can approach optimization: Classic optimization: second-order methods, constrained optimization, etc. Machine learning: stochastic methods, implicit regularization + early stopping Deep learning: initialization, normalization (changes to the model architecture) Large language models: stability issues, weird learning rates While some of the intuitions (e.g., second-order methods) are still useful, there are many other unique challenges that need to be overcome for large language model training to work. Unfortunately, much of this is fairly ad-hoc and poorly understood. ADAM (adaptive moment estimation) .  ADAM  incorporates two ideas: Use  momentum (keep on moving in the same direction). Have an adaptive (different) step size for each dimension of \\(\\theta\\) (inspiration from second-order methods). Initialize parameters \\(\\theta_0\\). Initialize moments \\(m_0, v_0 \\leftarrow 0\\). Repeat: Sample a mini-batch \\(B_t \\subset \\sD\\). Update parameters as follows. Updating parameters . Compute gradient: Update first- and second-order moments: Do bias correction: Update parameters: Memory . Using Adam increases the amount of storage from \\(2(\\text{num-params})\\) (from \\(\\theta_t,g_t\\)) to \\(4(\\text{num-params})\\) (from \\(\\theta_t,g_t,m_t,v_t\\)). AdaFactor ( Shazeer & Stern, 2018 ) was proposed as a way to reduce this memory footprint. Instead of storing the moments (\\(m_t,v_t\\)) of a \\(O(m \\times n)\\) matrix, store row and column sums (\\(O(m + n)\\) memory) and reconstruct the matrix. Remove momentum. It was used to train T5. It can be difficult to get AdaFactor to train (see  Twitter thread and blog post ). Mixed-precision training is another method for reducing memory ( Narang et al., 2018 ). Default: FP32 (32-bit floating point). Option: FP16 (16-bit floating point), but the problem is that any value less than \\(2^{-24}\\) becomes 0. Solution: store master weights in FP32 and do everything else in FP16. Loss scaling: scale up loss to avoid gradients with small magnitudes. Result: Halves the memory usage. Learning rates . Normally, the learning rate  decreases over time. For Transformers, we actually need to  increase the learning rate (warmup). Huang et al., 2020 show that a potential reason for this is to prevent vanishing gradients from layer normalization leads to instability in Adam optimizer. Initialization . Given a matrix \\(W \\in \\R^{m \\times n}\\), the standard initialization (xavier initialization) is \\(W_{ij} \\sim \\sN(0, 1/n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the fan-in. GPT-2 and GPT-3 scale the weights by an additional \\(1/\\sqrt{N}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of residual layers. T5 scales the attention matrices by an additional \\(1/\\sqrt{d}\\) ( code ). For GPT-3: Adam parameters: \\(\\beta_1 = 0.9\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0.95\\), \\(\\epsilon = 10^{-8}\\). Batch size: 3.2 million tokens (~1500 sequences) Use gradient clipping (\\(g_t \\leftarrow g_t / \\min(1, \\|g\\|_2)\\)). Linear learning rate warmup (over first 375 million tokens). Cosine learning rate that goes down to 10% of value. Gradually increase the batch size. Weight decay 0.1.

Using Adam increases the amount of storage from \\(2(\\text{num-params})\\) (from \\(\\theta_t,g_t\\)) to \\(4(\\text{num-params})\\) (from \\(\\theta_t,g_t,m_t,v_t\\)).\nAdaFactor ([Shazeer & Stern, 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04235.pdf)) was proposed as a way to reduce this memory footprint.\n- Instead of storing the moments (\\(m_t,v_t\\)) of a \\(O(m \\times n)\\) matrix, store row and column sums (\\(O(m + n)\\) memory) and reconstruct the matrix.\n- Remove momentum.\n- It was used to train T5.\n- It can be difficult to get AdaFactor to train (see\n[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/_arohan_/status/1468673364889726985?s=20&t=i7E0NN5ytysukMGVWG7lfQ)and[blog post](https://blog.ceshine.net/post/adafactor/)).\nMixed-precision training is another method for reducing memory ([Narang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03740.pdf)).\n- Default: FP32 (32-bit floating point).\n- Option: FP16 (16-bit floating point), but the problem is that any value less than \\(2^{-24}\\) becomes 0.\n- Solution: store master weights in FP32 and do everything else in FP16.\n- Loss scaling: scale up loss to avoid gradients with small magnitudes.\n- Result: Halves the memory usage.\nLearning rates.\n- Normally, the learning rate\ndecreasesover time. - For Transformers, we actually need to\nincreasethe learning rate (warmup). [Huang et al., 2020](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mvolkovs/ICML2020_tfixup.pdf)show that a potential reason for this is to prevent vanishing gradients from layer normalization leads to instability in Adam optimizer.\nInitialization.\n- Given a matrix \\(W \\in \\R^{m \\times n}\\), the standard initialization (xavier initialization) is \\(W_{ij} \\sim \\sN(0, 1/n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the fan-in.\n- GPT-2 and GPT-3 scale the weights by an additional \\(1/\\sqrt{N}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of residual layers.\n- T5 scales the attention matrices by an additional \\(1/\\sqrt{d}\\) (\n[code](https://github.com/tensorflow/mesh/blob/master/mesh_tensorflow/transformer/attention.py#L459)).\nFor GPT-3:\n- Adam parameters: \\(\\beta_1 = 0.9\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0.95\\), \\(\\epsilon = 10^{-8}\\).\n- Batch size: 3.2 million tokens (~1500 sequences)\n- Use gradient clipping (\\(g_t \\leftarrow g_t / \\min(1, \\|g\\|_2)\\)).\n- Linear learning rate warmup (over first 375 million tokens).\n[Cosine learning rate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03983v5.pdf)that goes down to 10% of value.- Gradually increase the batch size.\n- Weight decay 0.1.\nFurther reading\n[Mixed precision training](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2021/09/24/train-large-neural-networks.html#mixed-precision-training)[Fixing Weight Decay Regularization in Adam](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05101.pdf).I.

As with previous lectures, for example the one on social bias, much of what we will discuss is not necessarily specific to large language models (there is no Large Language Model Act). But whenever a  new powerful technology emerges, it raises many questions about whether existing laws still apply or make sense. For example,  (or cyberlaw) has emerged with the rising importance of the Internet. Internet law It draws from existing fields such as intellectual property law, privacy law, and contract law. Judge Frank Easterbrook used the term  Law of the Horse in 1996 to question why Internet law should be its own section of legal studies and litigation. But the Internet clearly has its own unique challenges: Laws usually had clear  jurisdiction (e.g., state, federal), but the Internet is not geographically bound. It is possible to remain  anonymous on the Internet. Anyone can post a piece of content that in principle can get be viewed by anyone. Laws usually had clear  Non-legal considerations . There is a distinction between  law  and  ethics . Law is enforceable by government, whereas ethics is not enforceable and can be created by any organization. Examples of  code of conducts , which aren\u2019t legal, but nonetheless important: Hippocratic Oath : from Ancient Greece, physicians swear to do no harm, respect privacy of patients, etc. ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct NeurIPS code of conduct : no harassment, no plagiarism Stanford Honor Code : no plagiarism, giving/receiving aid on an exam We will focus on law in this lecture, but let us not forget about ethics and norms, which is can be more agile. Jurisdiction . Depending on where you live (which country, which state, etc.), which laws apply vary. Different  countries (United States, China, EU) have different laws. For example, the EU\u2019s data privacy laws from  GDPR are much more comprehensive that what exists in the United States. For example, the EU\u2019s data privacy laws from  Laws can exist at the  federal, state, or local level. For example, California has privacy laws via the  California Consumer Privacy Act , which is analogous to GDPR, but has no federal counterpart. In Baldwin Park, California, it is illegal to ride a bicycle in a swimming pool ( reference ). For example, California has privacy laws via the  We will focus by default on United States, but will mention the EU at various times, since the EU are leading the charge with data privacy (GDPR) and AI regulation ( EU AI Act ). Types of law . Common law (judiciary): Also known as case law, common law is based on judges referencing previous similar cases and making a ruling ( precedent ). Example of a case (lawsuit): Oracle v. Google Statutory law (legislature): Also known as written law, statutory law is produced by government agencies through the legislative process (e.g., congress passing a bill). Example of a statute: Copyright Act of 1976 Often common law exists for a while before being codified into a statute (fair use was common law since the 1840s and finally became codified in 1976). Regulatory law (executive): Also known as administrative law, this is law that is created by the executive branch of government, often focusing on procedures. Example: the legislative branch passes a law authorizing the creation of a new executive agency (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency), and then the EPA passes regulations to meet its mandate. Large language models . Now let turn our attention to large language models. Recall the  lifecycle  of a large language model: Collect training data (e.g., Common Crawl). Train a large language model (e.g., GPT-3). Adapt it to downstream tasks (e.g., dialogue). Deploy the language model to users (e.g., customer service chatbot). There are two main areas where the law intersects the large language models lifecycle: Data . All machine learning relies on  data . Language models rely on a lot of data, especially other people\u2019s data made for a different purpose, and often scraped without consent. Copyright law protects creators (of data). Is training language models on this data a copyright violation? Privacy law protects individuals right to privacy. Can training language models on either public or private data violate privacy? For private data, when is collection and aggregation of this data even allowed? While these laws are centered around data, also relevant is what you do with the data. All machine learning relies on  Applications . Language models can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks (e.g., question answering, chatbots). Technologies can be used  intentionally for harm (e.g., spam, phishing attacks, harassment, disinformation). Existing Internet fraud and abuse laws might cover some of this. They could be deployed in various  high-stakes settings (e.g., healthcare, lending, education). Existing regulation in the respective areas (e.g., healthcare) could cover some of this. Of course, the expanded capabilities of large language models (e.g., realistic text generation, chatbots) will introduce new challenges. Today, we will mostly focus on  copyright law .    Copyright law Copyright law  Large language models, or any machine learning model, is trained on data, which results from the fruits of a human being\u2019s labor (e.g., author, programmer, photographer, etc.). What can someone other than the creators can do with these creations (e.g., books, code, photographs, etc.) is in the realm of intellectual property law. Intellectual property law . Motivation: encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. If anyone could just take your hard work and profit from it, people would be less incentivized to create or share. Types of intellectual property: copyright, patents, trademarks, trade secrets.  Copyright law . The key legislation that governs copyright in the United States is  Copyright Act of 1976 . Copyright protection applies to \u201coriginal works of authorship  fixed in any tangible medium of expression , now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device\u201d. Expanded scope from \u201cpublished\u201d (1909) to \u201cfixed\u201d, basing on the  Berne Convention of 1886. Registration is not required for copyright protection (in contrast with patents). Registration is required before creator can sue someone for copyright infringement. Note: the threshold for copyright is extremely low (you have copyright protection on many things you probably didn\u2019t realize). Lasts for 75 years, and then the copyright expires and it becomes part of the  public domain (works of Shakespeare, Beethoven, etc.). Most of Project Gutenberg are books in the public domain. There are two ways you can use a copyrighted work: Get a license for it. Appeal to the fair use clause. A  license (from contract law) is granted by a licensor to a licensee. Effectively, \u201ca license is a promise not to sue\u201d. The  Creative Commons license , enable free distribution of copyrighted work. Examples include Wikipedia, Open Courseware, Khan Academy, Free Music Archive, 307 million images from Flickr, 39 million images from MusicBrainz, 10 million videos from YouTube, etc. Fair use (section 107) . Previously common law since the 1840s. Four factors to determine whether fair use applies: the  purpose and character of the use (educational favored over commercial, transformative favored over reproductive); the nature of the copyrighted work (fictional favored over factual, the degree of creativity); the amount and substantiality of the portion of the  original work used; and the effect of the use upon the  market (or potential market) for the original work. the  Example of fair use: watch a movie, write a summary of it Example of fair use: reimplement an algorithm (the idea) rather than copying the code (the expression). Terms of service . There is one additional hurdle:  terms of service , which might impose additional restrictions. Example: YouTube\u2019s terms of service prohibits downloading videos, even if the videos are licensed under Creative Commons. Notes : Facts and ideas are not copyrightable. Database of facts can be copyrightable if curation / arrangement is considered expression. Copying data (first step of training) is violation already even if you don\u2019t do anything with it. Statutory damages are up to $150,000 per work (Section 504 of Copyright Act). Plaintiffs are small (owners of books), defendants are big companies. Next, we will go over a number of cases that have ruled for or against fair use. Google Book Search scanned printed books and made them searchable online (showed snippets), launched in 2002. Authors Guild complained that Google had not sought their permission for books still protected by copyright. 2013: District Court granted  summary judgment in favor of Google, deemed fair use . Google replicated 37 Java APIs in Android operating system that was owned by Oracle (formerly Sun Microsystems). Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement. April 2021: Supreme Court ruled that Google\u2019s use of Java APIs covered by  fair use . TVEyes recorded television programming, created a service that allows people to search (via text) and watch 10-second clips. Fox News sued TVEyes. 2018: 2nd district ruled in favor of Fox News,  not fair use . Justification: While transformative, deprives Fox News of revenue. Arriba created a search engine that shows thumbnails. Kelly (an individual) sued Arriba. 2003: 9th circuit ruled in favor of favor Arriba, deemed it  fair use . Sega Genesis game console released in 1989. Accolade wanted to release games on Genesis, but Sega charged extra, wants to be exclusive publisher. Accolade reverse engineered Sega\u2019s code to make new version, bypassing security lockouts. Sega sued Accolade in 1991. 1992: 9th circuit ruled in favor of Accolade, deeming it  fair use (mostly original content, competition benefits public, no evidenced it diminished Sega\u2019s market). \u201cNon-expressive\u201d: Accessing ideas, facts, not expression Fair learning  argues that machine learning is fair use: ML system\u2019s use of data is  transformative , doesn\u2019t change work, but changes purpose. ML system is interested in  idea (e.g., stop sign) not in the concrete expression (e.g., exact artistic choices of a particular image of a stop sign). Arguments for ML as fair use: Broad access to training data makes better systems for society. If don\u2019t allow, then most works cannot be used to produce new value. Using copyrighted data can be more fair  Levendowski, 2018 . Arguments against ML as fair use: Argue that ML systems don\u2019t produce a creative \u201cend product\u201d but just make money. Generative models (e.g., language models) can compete with creative professionals. Problems with ML systems (spread disinformation, enable surveillance, etc.), so don\u2019t give ML systems the benefit of the doubt. Challenge: hard to separate protectable (e.g., expression) from unprotectable (e.g., ideas). There are many reasons why building an ML system might be bad, but is copyright the right tool to stop it? Whether training large language models is fair use is rapidly evolving. Looking back at the history of information technology, we see three phases: First phase: text data mining (search engines), based on simple pattern matching. Second phase: classification (e.g., classify stop signs or sentiment analysis), recommendation systems. Third phase:  generative models that learn to mimic expression. Last time, we saw that it was possible to  extract training data from GPT-2 , which was potentially problematic from a point of view of privacy. If a language model spits out Harry Potter verbatim, this is problematic for fair use. However, even if the language model doesn\u2019t generate previous works verbatim, copyright is still relevant since the previous copyrighted works were used to train the language model. In fact, a language model can  compete with writers. For example, a writer writes 3 books, a language model trains on these 3 books, and auto-generates the 4th. Last time, we saw that it was possible to  Conclusion: the future of copyright and machine learning in light of large language models is very much open.    Privacy law Privacy law  Next we will briefly discuss some examples of privacy laws. The company was founded in 2017. New York Times article exposes it in 2019. As of October 2021, they have scraped 10 billion images of faces from Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Venmo, etc. It sells data to law enforcement agencies (e.g., FBI) and commercial organizations. Company argues a First Amendment right to public information. Lawsuit for violation of privacy. Illinois\u2019s  Biometric Information Privacy Act (2008) regulates biometric identifiers by private entities (doesn\u2019t include government entities). Clearview removed Illinois data. Deemed illegal by the EU by the Hamburg data protection authority (DPA). California Consumer Privacy Act (2018) Provide California residents with the right to: Know what personal data is being collected about them. Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom. Say no to the sale of personal data. Access their personal data. Request a business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer. Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights. Personal data: real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver\u2019s license number, license plate number, passport number, etc. Applies to business that operate in California and has at least $25 million in revenue. There is no equivalent at the federal level yet. Unlike GDPR, doesn\u2019t allow users to correct the data. California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 Creates California Privacy Protection Agency. Take effect Jan 1, 2023, applies to data collected after Jan 1, 2022. Intentions: Know who is collecting their and their children\u2019s personal information, how it is being used, and to whom it is disclosed. Control the use of their personal information, including limiting the use of their sensitive personal information. Have access to their personal information and the ability to correct, delete, and transfer their personal information. Exercise their privacy rights through easily accessible self-serve tools. Exercise their privacy rights without being penalized. Hold businesses accountable for failing to take reasonable information security precautions. Benefit from businesses\u2019 use of their personal information. Have their privacy interests protected even as employees and independent contractors. Regulation in EU law concerning data privacy. Adopted in 2016, enforceable in 2018. Broader than CCPA. Doesn\u2019t apply to processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement. Data subjects can provide consent to processing of personal data, and can withdraw at any time. People should have the right to access their own personal data. Google was fined $57 million because they did not obtain consent for ads personalization during Android phone setup.    Other laws Other laws  California\u2019s bot disclosure bill : Illegal to use a bot to communicate with a person without disclosing that it\u2019s a bot Restriction: applies only to incentivize a sale or influence a vote in an election. Restriction: applies only to public-facing websites with 10 million monthly US visitors.    Summary Summary  As we\u2019re training large language models, we have to confront copyright and fair use. The  uncurated nature of web crawls means you have to appeal to fair use (it would be very difficult to get licenses from everyone). The  generative aspect of models might present challenges for arguing fair use (can compete with humans). What level does it make sense to regulate (language models or downstream applications)? This space is quickly evolving and will require deep legal and AI expertise to make sensible decisions!

Now let turn our attention to large language models. Recall the lifecycle of a large language model:\n- Collect training data (e.g., Common Crawl).\n- Train a large language model (e.g., GPT-3).\n- Adapt it to downstream tasks (e.g., dialogue).\n- Deploy the language model to users (e.g., customer service chatbot).\nThere are two main areas where the law intersects the large language models lifecycle:\nData.- All machine learning relies on\ndata. - Language models rely on a lot of data, especially other people\u2019s data made for a different purpose, and often scraped without consent.\nCopyright lawprotects creators (of data). Is training language models on this data a copyright violation?Privacy lawprotects individuals right to privacy. Can training language models on either public or private data violate privacy? For private data, when is collection and aggregation of this data even allowed?- While these laws are centered around data, also relevant is what you do with the data.\n- All machine learning relies on\nApplications.- Language models can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks (e.g., question answering, chatbots).\n- Technologies can be used\n[intentionally for harm](https://crfm.stanford.edu/assets/report.pdf#misuse)(e.g., spam, phishing attacks, harassment, disinformation). Existing Internet fraud and abuse laws might cover some of this. - They could be deployed in various\nhigh-stakessettings (e.g., healthcare, lending, education). Existing regulation in the respective areas (e.g., healthcare) could cover some of this. - Of course, the expanded capabilities of large language models (e.g., realistic text generation, chatbots) will introduce new challenges.\nToday, we will mostly focus on [copyright law](https://stanford-cs324.github.io#copyright-law).\nCopyright law\nLarge language models, or any machine learning model, is trained on data, which results from the fruits of a human being\u2019s labor (e.g., author, programmer, photographer, etc.). What can someone other than the creators can do with these creations (e.g., books, code, photographs, etc.) is in the realm of intellectual property law.\nIntellectual property law.\n- Motivation: encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. If anyone could just take your hard work and profit from it, people would be less incentivized to create or share.\n- Types of intellectual property: copyright, patents, trademarks, trade secrets.\n[ Copyright law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright). The key legislation that governs copyright in the United States is\n[Copyright Act of 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976).\n- Copyright protection applies to \u201coriginal works of authorship\nfixedin any tangible medium ofexpression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device\u201d. - Expanded scope from \u201cpublished\u201d (1909) to \u201cfixed\u201d, basing on the\n[Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention)of 1886. Registration is not requiredfor copyright protection (in contrast with patents).- Registration is required before creator can sue someone for copyright infringement.\n- Note: the threshold for copyright is extremely low (you have copyright protection on many things you probably didn\u2019t realize).\n- Lasts for 75 years, and then the copyright expires and it becomes part of the\npublic domain(works of Shakespeare, Beethoven, etc.). Most of[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)are books in the public domain.\nThere are two ways you can use a copyrighted work:\n- Get a license for it.\n- Appeal to the fair use clause.\n- A\nlicense(from contract law) is granted by a licensor to a licensee. - Effectively, \u201ca license is a promise not to sue\u201d.\n- The\n[Creative Commons license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license), enable free distribution of copyrighted work. [Examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_Creative_Commons_licensed_works)include Wikipedia, Open Courseware, Khan Academy, Free Music Archive, 307 million images from Flickr, 39 million images from MusicBrainz, 10 million videos from YouTube, etc.\nFair use (section 107).\n- Previously common law since the 1840s.\n- Four factors to determine whether fair use applies:\n- the\npurposeand character of the use (educational favored over commercial,transformativefavored over reproductive); - the nature of the copyrighted work (fictional favored over factual, the degree of creativity);\n- the amount and substantiality of the portion of the\noriginal workused; and - the effect of the use upon the\nmarket(or potential market) for the original work.\n- the\n- Example of fair use: watch a movie, write a summary of it\n- Example of fair use: reimplement an algorithm (the idea) rather than copying the code (the expression).\nTerms of service. There is one additional hurdle: [terms of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service), which might impose additional restrictions.\n- Example: YouTube\u2019s terms of service prohibits downloading videos, even if the videos are licensed under Creative Commons.\nNotes:\n- Facts and ideas are not copyrightable.\n- Database of facts can be copyrightable if curation / arrangement is considered expression.\n- Copying data (first step of training) is violation already even if you don\u2019t do anything with it.\n- Statutory damages are up to $150,000 per work (Section 504 of Copyright Act).\n- Plaintiffs are small (owners of books), defendants are big companies.\nNext, we will go over a number of cases that have ruled for or against fair use.\n- Google Book Search scanned printed books and made them searchable online (showed snippets), launched in 2002.\n[Authors Guild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild)complained that Google had not sought their permission for books still protected by copyright.- 2013: District Court granted\n[summary judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment)in favor of Google, deemedfair use.\n- Google replicated 37 Java APIs in Android operating system that was owned by Oracle (formerly Sun Microsystems).\n- Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement.\n- April 2021: Supreme Court ruled that Google\u2019s use of Java APIs covered by\nfair use.\n- TVEyes recorded television programming, created a service that allows people to search (via text) and watch 10-second clips.\n- Fox News sued TVEyes.\n- 2018: 2nd district ruled in favor of Fox News,\nnot fair use. - Justification: While transformative, deprives Fox News of revenue.\n- Arriba created a search engine that shows thumbnails.\n- Kelly (an individual) sued Arriba.\n- 2003: 9th circuit ruled in favor of favor Arriba, deemed it\nfair use.\n- Sega Genesis game console released in 1989.\n- Accolade wanted to release games on Genesis, but Sega charged extra, wants to be exclusive publisher.\n- Accolade reverse engineered Sega\u2019s code to make new version, bypassing security lockouts.\n- Sega sued Accolade in 1991.\n- 1992: 9th circuit ruled in favor of Accolade, deeming it\nfair use(mostly original content, competition benefits public, no evidenced it diminished Sega\u2019s market). - \u201cNon-expressive\u201d: Accessing ideas, facts, not expression\n[Fair learning](https://texaslawreview.org/fair-learning/) argues that machine learning is fair use:\n- ML system\u2019s use of data is\ntransformative, doesn\u2019t change work, but changes purpose. - ML system is interested in\nidea(e.g., stop sign) not in the concreteexpression(e.g., exact artistic choices of a particular image of a stop sign). - Arguments for ML as fair use:\n- Broad access to training data makes better systems for society.\n- If don\u2019t allow, then most works cannot be used to produce new value.\n- Using copyrighted data can be more fair\n[Levendowski, 2018](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3024938).\n- Arguments against ML as fair use:\n- Argue that ML systems don\u2019t produce a creative \u201cend product\u201d but just make money.\n- Generative models (e.g., language models) can compete with creative professionals.\n- Problems with ML systems (spread disinformation, enable surveillance, etc.), so don\u2019t give ML systems the benefit of the doubt.\n- Challenge: hard to separate protectable (e.g., expression) from unprotectable (e.g., ideas).\n- There are many reasons why building an ML system might be bad, but is copyright the right tool to stop it?\nWhether training large language models is fair use is rapidly evolving. Looking back at the history of information technology, we see three phases:\n- First phase: text data mining (search engines), based on simple pattern matching.\n- Second phase: classification (e.g., classify stop signs or sentiment analysis), recommendation systems.\n- Third phase:\ngenerative modelsthat learn to mimic expression.- Last time, we saw that it was possible to\n[extract training data from GPT-2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07805.pdf), which was potentially problematic from a point of view of privacy. - If a language model spits out Harry Potter verbatim, this is problematic for fair use.\n- However, even if the language model doesn\u2019t generate previous works verbatim, copyright is still relevant since the previous copyrighted works were used to train the language model.\n- In fact, a language model can\ncompetewith writers. For example, a writer writes 3 books, a language model trains on these 3 books, and auto-generates the 4th.\n- Last time, we saw that it was possible to\n- Conclusion: the future of copyright and machine learning in light of large language models is very much open.\nPrivacy law\nNext we will briefly discuss some examples of privacy laws.\n- The company was founded in 2017.\n[New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html)exposes it in 2019.- As of October 2021, they have scraped 10 billion images of faces from Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Venmo, etc.\n- It sells data to law enforcement agencies (e.g., FBI) and commercial organizations.\n- Company argues a First Amendment right to public information.\n- Lawsuit for violation of privacy.\n- Illinois\u2019s\n[Biometric Information Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_Information_Privacy_Act)(2008) regulates biometric identifiers by private entities (doesn\u2019t include government entities).

However, prompting doesn\u2019t work on the full range of  downstream tasks (e.g., NLI, QA, converting web tables to text, parsing EHR records, etc.) Downstream tasks can differ from LM training data (e.g., the Pile) in format and topic, or require updating new knowledge over time. LMs need to be adapted to the downstream task with task-specific data or domain knowledge. Outline:    Why adapt the language model? Why adapt the language model?  LMs are trained in a task-agnostic way. Downstream tasks can be very different from language modeling on the Pile. For example, consider the natural language inference (NLI) task (is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?): Premise : I have never seen an apple that is not red. Hypothesis : I have never seen an apple. Correct output : Not entailment (the reverse direction would be entailment) The format of such a task may not be very natural for the model.    Ways downstream tasks can be different Ways downstream tasks can be different  Formatting : for example, NLI takes in two sentences and compares them to produce a single binary output. This is different from generating the next token or filling in MASKs. Another example is the presence of MASK tokens in BERT training vs. no MASKs in downstream tasks. Topic shift : the downstream task is focused on a new or very specific topic (e.g., medical records) Temporal shift : the downstream task requires new knowledge that is unavailable during pre-training because 1) the knowledge is new (e.g., GPT3 was trained before Biden became President), 2) the knowledge for the downstream task is not publicly available.    General adaptation setup General adaptation setup  In the adaptation phase, we train a new model that depends on pre-trained LM parameters \\(\\theta_{\\text{LM}}\\) that parameterize the LM \\(p\\). We are given a downstream dataset \\((x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), \\dots, (x^{(n)}, y^{(n)})\\) sampled from a downstream task distribution \\(P_{\\text{task}}\\). We minimize some parameters \\(\\gamma\\) from a family of parameters \\(\\Gamma\\) on a task loss \\(\\ell_{\\text{task}}\\) (e.g., cross entropy loss). The family of parameters \\(\\Gamma\\) may represent a subset of the existing parameters or introduce new parameters. The output of the optimization problem are the adapted parameters \\(\\gamma_{\\text{adapt}}\\), which parameterizes the adapted model \\(p_{\\text{adapt}}\\):    Probing Probing  Probing introduces a new set of parameters \\(\\Gamma\\) that define the family of  probes , which are usually linear or shallow feedforward networks. Probing is usually for  inspecting / understanding representations of the model. For example, if a simple probe on representations can predict part-of-speech (POS) tags, then the representations \u201cstore\u201d POS information. For adaptation, we train a probe (or prediction head) from the last layer representations of the LM to the output (e.g., class label). Mainly applies to encoder-only models (e.g.,  BERT ), but decoder-only models can also be used Liu et al. 2021 .    Strategies for fixed-length representations Strategies for fixed-length representations  A Transformer encoder maps a sequence of \\(L\\) tokens to \\(L\\) embeddings. Many tasks (e.g., classification) have fixed-length outputs. How do we get 1 embedding vector from a Transformer encoder? CLS token : During both pre-training and fine-tuning, we prepend a special token called CLS to the prompt. We use the embedding vector corresponding to the CLS token as the \u201csequence-level\u201d embedding. Devlin et al. 2018 Average over tokens : Another common way is to average over the \\(L\\) tokens. Note: this does not make the model permutation-invariant, since each embedding vector is contextual and position-dependent.    Summary Summary  Freeze (gray): language model representation encoder Optimize (blue, changes per task): probe (prediction head) Models : linear or shallow feedforward prediction head    Fine-tuning Fine-tuning  Fine-tuning uses the language model parameters \\(\\theta_{\\text{LM}}\\) as initialization for optimization. The family of optimized parameters \\(\\Gamma\\) contains all LM parameters and task-specific prediction head parameters. The optimizer state from pre-training is discarded. Fine-tuning usually uses at least a one order of magnitude smaller learning rate than during pre-training and is much shorter than pre-training. Fine-tuning requires storing a large language model specialized for every downstream task, which can be expensive. However, fine-tuning optimizes over a larger family of models (i.e., very  expressive ), and usually has better performance than probing.    Fine-tuning for zero-shot performance Fine-tuning for zero-shot performance  FLAN and T0 fine-tune the model for better zero-shot performance. They unify the prompt format of many downstream tasks and fine-tune the model to perform diverse tasks with this formatting. Zero-shot performance on unseen tasks improves over the original language model. The model is learning to use the prompt format to do zero-shot tasks.    Fine-tuning for human-aligned language models Fine-tuning for human-aligned language models  Given instructions in a prompt, LMs should produce outputs that are helpful (useful for the user), honest (don\u2019t mislead the user), and harmless (doesn\u2019t cause physical, psychological, or social harm). Language modeling is not inherently aligned with these goals. InstructGPT aligns the LM (GPT-3) with 3 steps: 1) Collect human-written demonstrations of desired behavior. Do supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations. 2) On a set of instructions, sample \\(k\\) outputs from the LM from step 1 for each instruction. Gather human preferences for which sampled output is most preferred - this data is cheaper to collect than step 1. 3) Fine-tune the LM from step 1 with a reinforcement learning objective to maximize the human preference reward. A 1.3B InstructGPT model produces outputs that are preferred to 175B GPT-3 85% of the time, and 71% when using few-shot prompts with GPT-3. On closed-domain QA/summarization, InstructGPT hallucinates information 21% of the time vs 41% in GPT-3 InstructGPT generates 25% fewer toxic outputs than GPT-3 when prompted to be respectful InstructGPT doesn\u2019t improve bias: not much benefit on Winogender and CrowSPairs    Summary Summary  Freeze (gray): nothing Optimize (blue, changes per task): all parameters of the language model, plus a new prediction head    Lightweight Fine-tuning Lightweight Fine-tuning  Lightweight fine-tuning aims to have the expressivity of full fine-tuning while not requiring us to store the full language model for every task. Many lightweight fine-tuning variants - amongst them we discuss prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and adapter tuning.     Prompt tuning [Lester et al., 2021]  Prompt tuning [Lester et al., 2021] Developed for text classification tasks on the  T5 model (an encoder-decoder) Motivated by prompt design/engineering in inference-based adaptation, prompt tuning prepends \\(k\\) learnable, continuous token embeddings (this defines \\(\\Gamma\\))to the input (so the input is now length \\(L\u2019=L+k\\)) and trains this on the labeled task data. The entire pre-trained language model is frozen. Scaling improves prompt tuning: with larger frozen language models, prompt tuning\u2019s performance becomes more competitive with full fine-tuning (\u201cmodel tuning\u201d). Learned prompt embedding initialization strategies: Embeddings of random vocab words Embeddings of class label words Random init: doesn\u2019t work well     Prefix tuning [Li and Liang, 2021]  Prefix tuning [Li and Liang, 2021] Developed for language generation tasks on the  BART and GPT-2 models For \\(k\\) positions prepended to the input, concatenate additional learnable weights for keys and values at  every attention layer. Different to prompt tuning (only learnable input vectors). To define prefix tuning, we use a generalized definition of an attention operation, which takes in 3 arguments: the key \\(K \\in \\R^{d\\times L\u2019}\\), value \\(V \\in \\R^{d \\times L\u2019}\\), and query \\(Q \\in \\R^{d \\times L}\\): where for self-attention, we set \\(L'=L\\) and define \\(K = W_{\\text{key}}\\x\\), \\(V = W_{\\text{value}}\\x\\) and \\(Q = W_{\\text{query}}\\x\\), where \\(W_{\\text{key}}, W_{ \\text{value}}, W_{\\text{query}}\\) are learned weight matrices. For attention head \\(i\\), prefix tuning computes attention with a larger \\(L\u2019 = L + k\\) by concatenating learnable weights \\(P_{\\text{key}}^{(i)} , P_{\\text{value}}^{(i)} \\in \\R^{d \\times k}\\) to the key and value  He et al. 2022 : where \\(Q = W_{\\text{query}}\\x\\) as in regular self-attention. Trainable parameters at all layers helps Prompt tuning v2 is the all-layer version of prompt tuning. All layer parameters seem to help for text classification and generation.     Adapter tuning [Houlsby et al. 2019] Adapter tuning [Houlsby et al. 2019] Add a new learned \u201cbottleneck\u201d layer (adapters) between each (frozen) Transformer layer Adapters are usually 2-layer residual networks that operate on each element \\(x \\in \\R^d\\) of the sequence individually: where \\(W_{\\text{down}}\\in \\R^{r \\times d}\\) and \\(W_{\\text{up}}\\in \\R^{d \\times r}\\) are learned weights that project \\(x\\) down to a bottleneck dimension \\(r\\) and back up to dimension \\(d\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) is a non-linear activation function. The result \\(\\text{Adapter}(x)\\) is a vector in \\(\\R^d\\) with the same dimensionality as \\(x\\). Note: How expressive is lightweight fine-tuning? Complex since expressivity is tied to the particular pre-trained LM - if the pre-trained LM has weights that are 0, then prompt/prefix tuning would not do anything.    Parallelization over prefixes/prompts Parallelization over prefixes/prompts  Suppose we want to deploy a personalized model for \\(N\\) users. With prefix tuning, we can store \\(N\\) prefixes, one for each user Run personalized model for each user in parallel across a minibatch by prepending the corresponding user-specific prefix to each input in the minibatch.    Robustness of lightweight fine-tuning Robustness of lightweight fine-tuning  Lightweight fine-tuning methods tend to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to full fine-tuning, for example on text from different topics or domains. Prompt tuning improves OOD accuracy : Table of F1 results from prompt tuning vs full fine-tuning (Model tuning) trained on SQuAD and tested on out-of-domain MRQA 2019 tasks Prefix tuning improves OOD accuracy : on the XSUM summarization task, where models are fine-tuned on news articles and tested on sports (news-to-sports) or trained on {world, UK, business} articles and tested on {health, technology} articles (within-news). For XSUM, the metric used is ROUGE-L, an automatic evaluation metric for summarization based on matching length \\(L\\) subsequences with a reference summarization. Note that when the test dataset is not out-of-distribution, prefix tuning\u2019s accuracy is usually slightly worse than full fine-tuning.    Summary Summary  Freeze (gray): whole/most of language model Optimize (blue, changes per task): small number of additional parameters (<1% of the parameters) Methods : prompt tuning, prefix tuning, adapter tuning, and others ( LoRA , BitFit , \u2026)    Overall summary Overall summary  We need to adapt large language models to the diverse array of downstream tasks, which may be very different from language modeling. Probing trains a task-specific prediction head on top of a frozen language model, treating the language model as a good representation extractor. Freezing the language model tends to limit the expressivity of the method. Fine-tuning treats the large language model parameters as initialization for further training all of the parameters on a downstream task, which is much more expressive than probing but more expensive since we have to save the whole model for each downstream task. Lightweight fine-tuning strikes a balance between fine-tuning and probing by optimizing only a few parameters (<%1 of the model), but it optimizes high-leverage parts of the model so that it is still very expressive.

This is different from generating the next token or filling in MASKs. Another example is the presence of MASK tokens in BERT training vs. no MASKs in downstream tasks.Topic shift: the downstream task is focused on a new or very specific topic (e.g., medical records)Temporal shift: the downstream task requires new knowledge that is unavailable during pre-training because 1) the knowledge is new (e.g., GPT3 was trained before Biden became President), 2) the knowledge for the downstream task is not publicly available.\nGeneral adaptation setup\n- In the adaptation phase, we train a new model that depends on pre-trained LM parameters \\(\\theta_{\\text{LM}}\\) that parameterize the LM \\(p\\).\n- We are given a downstream dataset \\((x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), \\dots, (x^{(n)}, y^{(n)})\\) sampled from a downstream task distribution \\(P_{\\text{task}}\\).\n- We minimize some parameters \\(\\gamma\\) from a family of parameters \\(\\Gamma\\) on a task loss \\(\\ell_{\\text{task}}\\) (e.g., cross entropy loss).\n- The family of parameters \\(\\Gamma\\) may represent a subset of the existing parameters or introduce new parameters.\n- The output of the optimization problem are the adapted parameters \\(\\gamma_{\\text{adapt}}\\), which parameterizes the adapted model \\(p_{\\text{adapt}}\\):\nProbing\n- Probing introduces a new set of parameters \\(\\Gamma\\) that define the family of\nprobes, which are usually linear or shallow feedforward networks. - Probing is usually for\n[inspecting / understanding representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03368.pdf)of the model. For example, if a simple probe on representations can predict part-of-speech (POS) tags, then the representations \u201cstore\u201d POS information. - For adaptation, we train a probe (or prediction head) from the last layer representations of the LM to the output (e.g., class label).\n- Mainly applies to encoder-only models (e.g.,\n[BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)), but decoder-only models can also be used[Liu et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10385.pdf).\nStrategies for fixed-length representations\nA Transformer encoder maps a sequence of \\(L\\) tokens to \\(L\\) embeddings. Many tasks (e.g., classification) have fixed-length outputs. How do we get 1 embedding vector from a Transformer encoder?\nCLS token: During both pre-training and fine-tuning, we prepend a special token called CLS to the prompt. We use the embedding vector corresponding to the CLS token as the \u201csequence-level\u201d embedding.[Devlin et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)Average over tokens: Another common way is to average over the \\(L\\) tokens. Note: this does not make the model permutation-invariant, since each embedding vector is contextual and position-dependent.\nSummary\nFreeze(gray): language model representation encoderOptimize(blue, changes per task): probe (prediction head)Models: linear or shallow feedforward prediction head\nFine-tuning\n- Fine-tuning uses the language model parameters \\(\\theta_{\\text{LM}}\\) as initialization for optimization.\n- The family of optimized parameters \\(\\Gamma\\) contains all LM parameters and task-specific prediction head parameters.\n- The optimizer state from pre-training is discarded.\n- Fine-tuning usually uses at least a one order of magnitude smaller learning rate than during pre-training and is much shorter than pre-training.\n- Fine-tuning requires storing a large language model specialized for every downstream task, which can be expensive.\n- However, fine-tuning optimizes over a larger family of models (i.e., very\nexpressive), and usually has better performance than probing.\nFine-tuning for zero-shot performance\n[FLAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01652.pdf)and[T0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08207.pdf)fine-tune the model for better zero-shot performance.- They unify the prompt format of many downstream tasks and fine-tune the model to perform diverse tasks with this formatting.\n- Zero-shot performance on unseen tasks improves over the original language model.\n- The model is learning to use the prompt format to do zero-shot tasks.\nFine-tuning for human-aligned language models\n- Given instructions in a prompt, LMs should produce outputs that are helpful (useful for the user), honest (don\u2019t mislead the user), and harmless (doesn\u2019t cause physical, psychological, or social harm).\n- Language modeling is not inherently aligned with these goals.\n[InstructGPT](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Training_language_models_to_follow_instructions_with_human_feedback.pdf)aligns the LM (GPT-3) with 3 steps:- 1) Collect human-written demonstrations of desired behavior.

Different to prompt tuning (only learnable input vectors). - To define prefix tuning, we use a generalized definition of an attention operation, which takes in 3 arguments: the key \\(K \\in \\R^{d\\times L\u2019}\\), value \\(V \\in \\R^{d \\times L\u2019}\\), and query \\(Q \\in \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nwhere for self-attention, we set \\(L'=L\\) and define \\(K = W_{\\text{key}}\\x\\), \\(V = W_{\\text{value}}\\x\\) and \\(Q = W_{\\text{query}}\\x\\), where \\(W_{\\text{key}}, W_{ \\text{value}}, W_{\\text{query}}\\) are learned weight matrices.\n- For attention head \\(i\\), prefix tuning computes attention with a larger \\(L\u2019 = L + k\\) by concatenating learnable weights \\(P_{\\text{key}}^{(i)} , P_{\\text{value}}^{(i)} \\in \\R^{d \\times k}\\) to the key and value\n[He et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04366.pdf):\nwhere \\(Q = W_{\\text{query}}\\x\\) as in regular self-attention.\nTrainable parameters at all layers helps\n[Prompt tuning v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07602.pdf)is the all-layer version of prompt tuning.- All layer parameters seem to help for text classification and generation.\n[Adapter tuning [Houlsby et al. 2019]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00751.pdf)\n- Add a new learned \u201cbottleneck\u201d layer (adapters) between each (frozen) Transformer layer\n- Adapters are usually 2-layer residual networks that operate on each element \\(x \\in \\R^d\\) of the sequence individually:\nwhere \\(W_{\\text{down}}\\in \\R^{r \\times d}\\) and \\(W_{\\text{up}}\\in \\R^{d \\times r}\\) are learned weights that project \\(x\\) down to a bottleneck dimension \\(r\\) and back up to dimension \\(d\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) is a non-linear activation function. The result \\(\\text{Adapter}(x)\\) is a vector in \\(\\R^d\\) with the same dimensionality as \\(x\\).\n- Note: How expressive is lightweight fine-tuning? Complex since expressivity is tied to the particular pre-trained LM - if the pre-trained LM has weights that are 0, then prompt/prefix tuning would not do anything.\nParallelization over prefixes/prompts\n- Suppose we want to deploy a personalized model for \\(N\\) users.\n- With prefix tuning, we can store \\(N\\) prefixes, one for each user\n- Run personalized model for each user in parallel across a minibatch by prepending the corresponding user-specific prefix to each input in the minibatch.\nRobustness of lightweight fine-tuning\n- Lightweight fine-tuning methods tend to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to full fine-tuning, for example on text from different topics or domains.\n[Prompt tuning improves OOD accuracy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08691.pdf): Table of F1 results from prompt tuning vs full fine-tuning (Model tuning) trained on SQuAD and tested on out-of-domain MRQA 2019 tasks\n[Prefix tuning improves OOD accuracy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00190.pdf): on the XSUM summarization task, where models are fine-tuned on news articles and tested on sports (news-to-sports) or trained on {world, UK, business} articles and tested on {health, technology} articles (within-news).- For XSUM, the metric used is ROUGE-L, an automatic evaluation metric for summarization based on matching length \\(L\\) subsequences with a reference summarization. Note that when the test dataset is not out-of-distribution, prefix tuning\u2019s accuracy is usually slightly worse than full fine-tuning.\nSummary\nFreeze(gray): whole/most of language modelOptimize(blue, changes per task): small number of additional parameters (<1% of the parameters)Methods: prompt tuning, prefix tuning, adapter tuning, and others ([LoRA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf),[BitFit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10199.pdf), \u2026)\nOverall summary\n- We need to adapt large language models to the diverse array of downstream tasks, which may be very different from language modeling.\nProbingtrains a task-specific prediction head on top of a frozen language model, treating the language model as a good representation extractor.

Now, we peel open the first layer of the onion and start discussing how these models are constructed. The starting point of any machine learning approach is  training data , so this is where we\u2019ll start. Aside : Normally in machine learning, the training data and the test (evaluation) data are similar or at least of the same type. But for large language models, the training data is just \u201craw text\u201d. In the rest of the lecture, we\u2019ll talk about:    Data behind large language models Data behind large language models  Recall that large language models are trained on \u201craw text\u201d. To be highly capable (e.g., have linguistic and world knowledge), this text should span a  broad  range of domains, genres, languages, etc. A natural place (but not the only place) to look for such text is the  web , so this will be a major focus of our attention. The web is absolutely huge. As a lower bound, the Google search index is 100 petabytes ( reference ). The actual web is likely even larger, and the  Deep Web  is even larger than that. It is worth noting that  private datasets  that reside in big companies are even larger than what\u2019s available publicly. For example,  WalMart  generates 2.5 petabytes of data each hour! Common Crawl  is a nonprofit organization that crawls the web and provides snapshots that are free to the public. Because of its convenience, it has been a standard source of data to train many models such as T5, GPT-3, and Gopher. The April 2021 snapshot of  Common Crawl  has 320 terabytes of data, which is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the Google index. Representation . Despite the richness of web data, it has been noted in  Bender et al, 2021  that: Despite the size, large-scale data still has  uneven representation over the population. Internet data overrepresents younger users from developed countries. GPT-2\u2019s training data is based on Reddit, which according to Pew Internet Research\u2019s 2016 survey, 67% of Reddit users in the US are men, 64% between ages 18 and 29. 8.8-15% of Wikipedians are female. Harassment on Internet could turn away certain people (trans, queer, neurodivergent people). Filtering \u201cbad words\u201d could further marginalize certain populations (e.g., LGBT+). Takeaway: it is crucial to understand and document the composition of the datasets used to train large language models.    WebText and OpenWebText WebText and OpenWebText  WebText . The WebText dataset was used to train GPT-2. Goal: obtain  diverse but high-quality dataset. Previous work: Datasets were trained on news, Wikipedia, or fiction. Common Crawl contains a lot of junk (gibberish, boilerplate text). Trinh & Le, 2018 selected a tiny subset of Common Crawl based on n-gram overlap with the target task. Process for creating WebText: Scraped all outbound links that received at least 3 karma (upvotes). Filtered out Wikipedia to be able to evaluate on Wikipedia-based benchmarks. End result is 40 GB of text. OpenWebText . WebText was not released by OpenAI, but it was replicated (in spirit) by the  OpenWebText  dataset. Extracted all the URLs from the  Reddit submissions dataset . Used Facebook\u2019s  fastText to filter out non-English. Removed near duplicates. End result is 38 GB of text. Toxicity analysis .  Gehman et al. 2020 , the RealToxicityPrompts paper, analyzed these two datasets and found: 2.1% of OpenWebText has toxicity score >= 50% 4.3% of WebText (from OpenAI) has toxicity score >= 50% News reliability correlates negatively with toxicity (Spearman \\(\\rho = -0.35\\)) 3% of OpenWebText comes from  banned or quarantined subreddits , e.g., /r/The_Donald and /r/WhiteRights    Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus  The Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus ( C4 ) is a larger was created to train the T5 model. Started with April 2019 snapshot of Common Crawl (1.4 trillion tokens) Removed  \u201cbad words\u201d Removed code (\u201c{\u201c) langdetect to filter out non-English text Resulted in 806 GB of text (156 billion tokens) Analysis .  Dodge et al. 2021  performed a thorough analysis of the C4 dataset. Documentation levels: Metadata: provenance, utterance data Included data: machine or human authored, social biases, data contamination Excluded data: medical or health data, demographic identities Note:  Raffel et al. 2020  only provided scripts to recreate; cost thousands of dollars just to run these scripts. A surprising amount of data from patents.google.com 65% pages in the Internet Archive; out of those, 92% pages written in the last decade 51.3% pages are hosted in the United States; fewer from India even though lots of English speakers there Some text from patents.google.com are automatically created, and thus have systematic errors: Filed in a foreign country\u2019s official language (e.g., Japanese) is automatically translated into English Automatically generated from optical character recognition (OCR) Benchmark data contamination . When we are evaluating the capabilities of large language models using benchmark data (e.g., question-answer pairs), it makes a difference whether the benchmark data appears in the training data of the language model. If so, then the benchmark performance will be  biased up. Normally, in machine learning, data hygiene (keeping the training data separate from the test) is relatively easy, but in the case of large language models, both the training data and benchmark data are derived from the Internet, it can be difficult to a priori guarantee their separation. Example from the  XSum  summarization dataset: Input : The 48-year-old former Arsenal goalkeeper played for the Royals for four years. He was appointed youth academy director in 2000 and has been director of football since 2003. A West Brom statement said: \u201cHe played a key role in the Championship club twice winning promotion to the Premier League in 2006 and 2012.  Output : West Brom have appointed Nicky Hammond as technical director, ending his 20-year association with Reading. There are two types of contamination: Input-and-output contamination : both the input and output appear in the training data. Varies from 1.87% to 24.88% (XSum is 15.49%). Input contamination : the input appears in the training data. Varies from 1.8% to 53.6% (QNLI, which is derived from Wikipedia). Note that contamination is not due to hosting datasets (as they are usually stored in a JSON file, not as a webpage). The dataset could also be responsible for various harms: Representational harms They look at co-occurrence with ethnicity terms (e.g.,  Jewish ) and sentiment-bearing words (e.g., successful ). Jewish has 73.2% positive sentiment, Arab has 65.7% positive (7.5% difference). Variation across sites (New York Times had a 4.5% difference, Al Jazeera had 0% difference). They look at co-occurrence with ethnicity terms (e.g.,  Allocational harms Recall C4 is a filtered version of Common Crawl (only about 10%). Mentions of sexual orientations (e.g.,  lesbian , gay ) more likely to be filtered out; of those filtered out, non-trivial fraction are non-offensive (e.g., 22% and 36%). Certain dialects are more likely to be filtered (AAE: 42%, Hispanic-aligned English: 32%) than others (White American English: 6.2%)    GPT-3 dataset GPT-3 dataset  Selected subset of Common Crawl that\u2019s  similar to a reference dataset (WebText). Downloaded 41 shards of Common Crawl (2016-2019). Trained a binary classifier to predict WebText versus Common Crawl. Sampled (kept) a document with higher probability if classifier deems it more similar to WebText. Performed  fuzzy deduplication (detect 13-gram overlap, remove window or documents if occurred in <10 training documents), removing data from benchmark datasets. Expanded the diversity of the  data sources (WebText2, Books1, Books2, Wikipedia). During training, Common Crawl is downsampled (Common Crawl is 82% of the dataset, but contributes only 60%).    The Pile The Pile  While a web crawl is a natural place to look for broad data, it\u2019s not the only strategy, and GPT-3 already hinted that it might be productive to look at other sources of higher quality. EleutherAI (a nonprofit organization committed to building open language models), pushed this idea even farther. They released  The Pile , a dataset for language modeling, where the key idea is to source it from smaller high-quality sources (academic + professional sources). Data composition . 825 GB English text 22 high-quality datasets Compare: GPT-2Pile (1.5B parameters) trained on The Pile GPT-3 (175B parameters) trained on GPT-3\u2019s dataset. Normalize so that the difference for OpenWebText2 is 0. Takeaway: The Pile contains a lot of information that\u2019s not well covered by GPT-3\u2019s dataset. They also performed analysis of pejorative content, gender/religion biases. The findings are qualitatively similar to previous work.    Summary Summary  The total amount of data out there (web, private data) is massive. Training on \u201call of it\u201d (even Common Crawl) doesn\u2019t work well (not effective use of compute). Filtering / curation (OpenWebText, C4, GPT-3 dataset) is needed, but can result in biases. Curating non-web high-quality datasets is promising (The Pile). Important to carefully document and inspect these datasets.    Documentation for datasets Documentation for datasets  We now step back from the specifics of language modeling datasets and discuss general principles around data. It has been long noted that documentation is important, but within the machine learning community, it has been a fairly ad-hoc process. Examples from other fields: Electronics industry has a well-established protocol where every component has a datasheet with operating characteristics, test results, recommended and usage. Nutrition labels : The FDA mandates that food be labeled with their nutrition content. Datasheets for datasets ( Gebru et al., 2018 ) is an influential paper that provides community norms around documentation. Data statements ( Bender & Friedman, 2018 ) is related framework that is more tailored to language datasets. The emphasis is on  transparency . Two purposes: Dataset creators : reflect on decisions, potential harms (e.g., social biases) when creating the dataset. Dataset consumers : know when the dataset can and can\u2019t be used. Dataset lifecycle  (a sample of the questions from each category are provided below): Motivation For what purpose was the dataset created? Who created this dataset? Who funded the creation of the dataset? Composition What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Is any information missing from individual instances? Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential? Collection process How was the data associated with each instance acquired?

Data ecosystems Data ecosystems  So far, we have mostly focused on the analysis of existing datasets (for large language models) as well as documentation. But data is a broad concept which can be studied from many other angles. Data management : In machine learning research, we tend to think of datasets as fixed objects that you collect and you feed into a training algorithm. In the the databases community, there is whole subfield thinking about the ecosystem in which data comes to be and is used, and this is particularly relevant in  industry . Some issues are discussed in the  data section of the foundation models report . Data governance talks about how an organization can create data, maintain its quality and security. The BigScience project (initiated by Hugging Face) aims to collect a large multilingual dataset as well as train a large language model. The  BigScience data governance working group has been developing a framework to responsibly curate quality data sources, in contrast to the indiscriminate scraping of the web. Data dignity . This is a concept that originated out of Microsoft and RadicalxChange that seeks to think about the nature of data. People create data. Because people live in social environments, data also is a property not of individuals, but of groups of people. Examples: emails, genetic data. Individually, data does not have value, but collectively, it has a lot of value. Related:  Data Shapley is a framework for ascribing value to a given data point in the context of machine learning. Status quo: people give away their data for free, and big corporations derive tons of value and power from it. Example: Alice and Bob are both writers. Alice provide examples of writing for free. This can be used to train a language model that can replace Bob. Think about data as  labor rather than property rights. Data privacy works on the individual level, and doesn\u2019t work. Proposal:  data coalitions , which are intermediate organizations that represent between data producers and data buyers (think about collective bargaining). Read  this article for more details.

ICML 2019. Data Freedom Act", "text": "So far, we\u2019ve talked about the behavior (capabilities and harms) of large language models. Now, we peel open the first layer of the onion and start discussing how these models are constructed. The starting point of any machine learning approach is training data, so this is where we\u2019ll start.\nAside: Normally in machine learning, the training data and the test (evaluation) data are similar or at least of the same type. But for large language models, the training data is just \u201craw text\u201d.\nIn the rest of the lecture, we\u2019ll talk about:\nData behind large language models\nRecall that large language models are trained on \u201craw text\u201d. To be highly capable (e.g., have linguistic and world knowledge), this text should span a broad range of domains, genres, languages, etc.\nA natural place (but not the only place) to look for such text is the web, so this will be a major focus of our attention. The web is absolutely huge. As a lower bound, the Google search index is 100 petabytes ([reference](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/organizing-information/)). The actual web is likely even larger, and the [Deep Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web) is even larger than that.\nIt is worth noting that private datasets that reside in big companies are even larger than what\u2019s available publicly. For example, [WalMart](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/01/23/really-big-data-at-walmart-real-time-insights-from-their-40-petabyte-data-cloud) generates 2.5 petabytes of data each hour!\nCommon Crawl is a nonprofit organization that crawls the web and provides snapshots that are free to the public. Because of its convenience, it has been a standard source of data to train many models such as T5, GPT-3, and Gopher. The April 2021 snapshot of [Common Crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Crawl) has 320 terabytes of data, which is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the Google index.\nRepresentation. Despite the richness of web data, it has been noted in [Bender et al, 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922) that:\n- Despite the size, large-scale data still has\nuneven representationover the population. - Internet data overrepresents younger users from developed countries.\n- GPT-2\u2019s training data is based on Reddit, which according to Pew Internet Research\u2019s 2016 survey, 67% of Reddit users in the US are men, 64% between ages 18 and 29.\n- 8.8-15% of Wikipedians are female.\n- Harassment on Internet could turn away certain people (trans, queer, neurodivergent people).\n- Filtering \u201cbad words\u201d could further marginalize certain populations (e.g., LGBT+).\nTakeaway: it is crucial to understand and document the composition of the datasets used to train large language models.\nWebText and OpenWebText\nWebText. The WebText dataset was used to train GPT-2.\n- Goal: obtain\ndiversebuthigh-qualitydataset. - Previous work:\n- Datasets were trained on news, Wikipedia, or fiction.\n- Common Crawl contains a lot of junk (gibberish, boilerplate text).\n[Trinh & Le, 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02847.pdf)selected a tiny subset of Common Crawl based on n-gram overlap with the target task.\n- Process for creating WebText:\n- Scraped all outbound links that received at least 3 karma (upvotes).\n- Filtered out Wikipedia to be able to evaluate on Wikipedia-based benchmarks.\n- End result is 40 GB of text.\nOpenWebText. WebText was not released by OpenAI, but it was replicated (in spirit) by the [OpenWebText](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/) dataset.\n- Extracted all the URLs from the\n[Reddit submissions dataset](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/submissions/). - Used Facebook\u2019s\n[fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText)to filter out non-English. - Removed near duplicates.\n- End result is 38 GB of text.\nToxicity analysis. [Gehman et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11462.pdf), the RealToxicityPrompts paper, analyzed these two datasets and found:\n- 2.1% of OpenWebText has toxicity score >= 50%\n- 4.3% of WebText (from OpenAI) has toxicity score >= 50%\n- News reliability correlates negatively with toxicity (Spearman \\(\\rho = -0.35\\))\n- 3% of OpenWebText comes from\n[banned or quarantined subreddits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_Reddit_communities), e.g., /r/The_Donald and /r/WhiteRights\nColossal Clean Crawled Corpus\nThe Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus ([C4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4)) is a larger was created to train the T5 model.\n- Started with April 2019 snapshot of Common Crawl (1.4 trillion tokens)\n- Removed\n[\u201cbad words\u201d](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words/blob/master/en) - Removed code (\u201c{\u201c)\n- langdetect to filter out non-English text\n- Resulted in 806 GB of text (156 billion tokens)\nAnalysis. [Dodge et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08758.pdf) performed a thorough analysis of the C4 dataset.\nDocumentation levels:\n- Metadata: provenance, utterance data\n- Included data: machine or human authored, social biases, data contamination\n- Excluded data: medical or health data, demographic identities\nNote: [Raffel et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) only provided scripts to recreate; cost thousands of dollars just to run these scripts.\n- A surprising amount of data from patents.google.com\n- 65% pages in the Internet Archive; out of those, 92% pages written in the last decade\n- 51.3% pages are hosted in the United States; fewer from India even though lots of English speakers there\n- Some text from patents.google.com are automatically created, and thus have systematic errors:\n- Filed in a foreign country\u2019s official language (e.g., Japanese) is automatically translated into English\n- Automatically generated from optical character recognition (OCR)\nBenchmark data contamination.\n- When we are evaluating the capabilities of large language models using benchmark data (e.g., question-answer pairs), it makes a difference whether the benchmark data appears in the training data of the language model. If so, then the benchmark performance will be\nbiasedup. - Normally, in machine learning, data hygiene (keeping the training data separate from the test) is relatively easy, but in the case of large language models, both the training data and benchmark data are derived from the Internet, it can be difficult to a priori guarantee their separation.\nExample from the [XSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum) summarization dataset:\nInput:The 48-year-old former Arsenal goalkeeper played for the Royals for four years. He was appointed youth academy director in 2000 and has been director of football since 2003. A West Brom statement said: \u201cHe played a key role in the Championship club twice winning promotion to the Premier League in 2006 and 2012.\nOutput:West Brom have appointed Nicky Hammond as technical director, ending his 20-year association with Reading.\nThere are two types of contamination:\nInput-and-output contamination: both the input and output appear in the training data. Varies from 1.87% to 24.88% (XSum is 15.49%).Input contamination: the input appears in the training data. Varies from 1.8% to 53.6% (QNLI, which is derived from Wikipedia).\nNote that contamination is not due to hosting datasets (as they are usually stored in a JSON file, not as a webpage).\nThe dataset could also be responsible for various harms:\nRepresentational harms- They look at co-occurrence with ethnicity terms (e.g.,\nJewish) and[sentiment-bearing words](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02820.pdf)(e.g.,successful). Jewishhas 73.2% positive sentiment,Arabhas 65.7% positive (7.5% difference).- Variation across sites (New York Times had a 4.5% difference, Al Jazeera had 0% difference).\n- They look at co-occurrence with ethnicity terms (e.g.,\nAllocational harms- Recall C4 is a filtered version of Common Crawl (only about 10%).\n- Mentions of sexual orientations (e.g.,\nlesbian,gay) more likely to be filtered out; of those filtered out, non-trivial fraction are non-offensive (e.g., 22% and 36%). - Certain dialects are more likely to be filtered (AAE: 42%, Hispanic-aligned English: 32%) than others (White American English: 6.2%)\nGPT-3 dataset\n- Selected subset of Common Crawl that\u2019s\nsimilar to a reference dataset(WebText).- Downloaded 41 shards of Common Crawl (2016-2019).\n- Trained a binary classifier to predict WebText versus Common Crawl.\n- Sampled (kept) a document with higher probability if classifier deems it more similar to WebText.\n- Performed\nfuzzy deduplication(detect 13-gram overlap, remove window or documents if occurred in <10 training documents), removing data from benchmark datasets. - Expanded the diversity of the\ndata sources(WebText2, Books1, Books2, Wikipedia). - During training, Common Crawl is downsampled (Common Crawl is 82% of the dataset, but contributes only 60%).\nThe Pile\n- While a web crawl is a natural place to look for broad data, it\u2019s not the only strategy, and GPT-3 already hinted that it might be productive to look at other sources of higher quality.\n- EleutherAI (a nonprofit organization committed to building open language models), pushed this idea even farther.\n- They released\n[The Pile](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00027.pdf), a dataset for language modeling, where the key idea is to source it from smaller high-quality sources (academic + professional sources).\nData composition.\n- 825 GB English text\n- 22 high-quality datasets\nCompare:\n- GPT-2Pile (1.5B parameters) trained on The Pile\n- GPT-3 (175B parameters) trained on GPT-3\u2019s dataset.\n- Normalize so that the difference for OpenWebText2 is 0.\nTakeaway: The Pile contains a lot of information that\u2019s not well covered by GPT-3\u2019s dataset.\nThey also performed analysis of pejorative content, gender/religion biases. The findings are qualitatively similar to previous work.\nSummary\n- The total amount of data out there (web, private data) is massive.\n- Training on \u201call of it\u201d (even Common Crawl) doesn\u2019t work well (not effective use of compute).\n- Filtering / curation (OpenWebText, C4, GPT-3 dataset) is needed, but can result in biases.\n- Curating non-web high-quality datasets is promising (The Pile).\n- Important to carefully document and inspect these datasets.\nDocumentation for datasets\nWe now step back from the specifics of language modeling datasets and discuss general principles around data.\n- It has been long noted that documentation is important, but within the machine learning community, it has been a fairly ad-hoc process.\n- Examples from other fields:\nElectronics industryhas a well-established protocol where every component has a datasheet with operating characteristics, test results, recommended and usage.Nutrition labels: The FDA mandates that food be labeled with their nutrition content.\n- Datasheets for datasets (\n[Gebru et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf)) is an influential paper that provides community norms around documentation. - Data statements (\n[Bender & Friedman, 2018](https://aclanthology.org/Q18-1041.pdf)) is related framework that is more tailored to language datasets. - The emphasis is on\ntransparency.\nTwo purposes:\nDataset creators: reflect on decisions, potential harms (e.g., social biases) when creating the dataset.Dataset consumers: know when the dataset can and can\u2019t be used.\nDataset lifecycle (a sample of the questions from each category are provided below):\n- Motivation\n- For what purpose was the dataset created?\n- Who created this dataset?\n- Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n- Composition\n- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?\n- Is any information missing from individual instances?\n- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential?\n- Collection process\n- How was the data associated with each instance acquired?\n- Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?\n- Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)?\n- Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling\n- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done?\n- Is the software that was used to preprocess/clean/label the data available?\n- Uses\n- Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?\n- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?\n- Distribution\n- How will the dataset will be distributed?\n- Have any third parties imposed IP-based or other restrictions on the data associated with the instances?\n- Maintenance\n- Who will be supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?\n- Will the dataset be updated (e.g., to correct labeling errors, add new instances, delete instances)?\nData statements.

We call these  behavioral harms  because these are harms due to the behavior of a language model rather than its construction (which would encompass data privacy and environmental impact). So far, we have described two types of behavioral harms: Performance disparities : a system is more accurate for some demographic groups (e.g., young people, White people) than others (e.g., old people, Black people). Example: language identification systems perform worse on African American English (AAE) than Standard English ( Blodgett et al. 2017 ): Example: language identification systems perform worse on African American English (AAE) than Standard English ( Social bias and stereotypes : a system\u2019s predictions (generated text) contains associations between a target concept (e.g., science) and a demographic group (e.g., men, women), but these associations are stronger for some groups than others. Example: autocomplete systems make gendered assumptions ( Robertson et al. 2021 ) ( demo ) Example: autocomplete systems make gendered assumptions ( Recall that these harms are not unique to large language models, or even language technologies, or even AI technologies. But it is important to study the harms of language models because: they have new, powerful capabilities, which leads to increased adoption, which leads to increased harms. Benefits versus harms . With any technology, it\u2019s important to consider the tradeoff between benefits and harms. This is very tricky business because: It is hard to  quantify the benefits and harms. Even if you could quantify them, the benefits and harms are spread out unevenly across the population (with marginalized populations often receiving more harms), so how one makes these  tradeoffs is a tricky ethical issue. Even if you could meaningfully tradeoff, what  legitimacy does the the decision maker have? Can Facebook or Google just unilaterally decide? Upstream versus downstream . We are considering harms of a system in the context of a  downstream task (e.g., question answering). These systems are  adapted from large language models. We would like to understand the contribution of the  upstream language model on harms. This is increasingly meaningful as the adaptation becomes thinner and the large language model does more of the  heavy lifting .    Overview Overview  In this lecture, we will discuss two more behavioral harms: Toxicity : large language models generating offensive, harmful content Disinformation : large language models generating misleading content Before we dive in, we should point out a disconnect: Language models are about  text . This is what they\u2019re trained on, and they good at capturing statistical patterns. These harms are about  people . It is about a person receiving a piece of text and feeling upset or hurt by it. This means that we need to think of the harms as not a property of the text, but in terms of the broader social context .    Content moderation Content moderation  Before we get to large language models, it is helpful to ground out toxicity and disinformation in the very critical problem of content moderation. Sites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube are constantly waging a war against people who post or upload harmful content (hate speech, harassment, pornography, violence, fraud, disinformation, copyright infringement). For example,  Facebook\u2019s Community Standards provides a broad list of things that are prohibited from the platform. Companies are under increasing pressure from government to keep online spaces safe for people. Given the scale of these companies, it is infeasible (and also  inhumane ) to perform content moderation manually, and gradually, companies have turned to AI to automate the process. The result of moderation could be hard (blocking, deletion) or soft (flagging, hiding). Note that decision of what is allowed is fundamentally political - What is a terrorist organization? What speech is allowed? Context-dependence . What constitutes harmful content is very  context-dependent .  Chandrasekhran et al. 2018  performed a detailed study on Reddit: 2.8M removed comments from 100 subredits over 10 months and asked how norms vary across different subreddits. While there are norms common to almost all subreddits, many norms are specific to subreddits, for example: No personal reactions/opinions: \u201cand this is why i love science, always on the pursuit of knowledge\u201d No links to illegal livestreams: \u201cfree live streaming chicago bulls los angeles lakers basketball\u201d Dual use . There are two ways in which language models can be used in the context of toxicity and disinformation: They can be used to  generate toxic content. Malicious actors can use it to amplify their message. They can be used to  detect disinformation and thus aid in content moderation.    Toxicity Toxicity  We want to understand the harms of large language models related to toxicity. There are two possible recipients of the harm: The  user of the LM-based system. A chatbot could reply with a toxic response. An autocomplete system could make a toxic suggestion. The  recipient of the user-generated content. The user, with or without malicious intent, might post the toxic content on social media. Working definition . What is toxicity? As mentioned above, harms are about what happens to people, so it is important to remember that the definition is very context-dependent. To make some progress, we can use the following working definition:  Borkan et al, 2017  defines toxicity as anything that is \u201crude, disrespectful, or unreasonable that would make someone want to leave a conversation.\u201d Examples: I bet China would be happy to help Puerto Rico rebuild in exchange for a nice military base. [toxicity: 0] The ignorance and bigotry comes from your post! [toxicity: 80%] Word lists . How far can one get by simply defining toxicity in terms of presence of certain  \u201cbad words\u201d ? Aside : The Clossal, Cleaned Common Crawl (C4) dataset was filtered using this word list and used to train the T5 language model. We will talk about the complexities of data later in the course. Using a word list is inadequate because: Genuinely harmful text contains no bad words. Example:  A trans woman is not a woman. Example:  Non-harmful text do contain bad words. Example: words used in the context of healthcare or sex education Example: profanity in fiction Example: slurs used by groups to reclaim terms ( York & McSherry, 2019 ); queer by the LGBT+ community ( Rand, 2014 ).    Perspective API Perspective API  Jigaw, a unit within Google focused on technological solutions to social problems (e.g., extremism), developed a popular (proprietary) service for performing toxicity classification called the Perspective API in 2017. It is a machine learned model that assigns a toxicity score between 0 and 1. It was trained on Wikipedia talk pages (where volunteer moderators discuss edit decisions) and labeled by crowdworkers. You can  try it out here . Anecdotally, it works for some things: hello [toxicity: low]  You suck [toxicity: 95.89%] However, it doesn\u2019t always work: You\u2019re like Hitler. [toxicity: low]  I hope you lose your right arm. [toxicity: low]  I read The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky yesterday. [toxicity: 86.06%]  That is f\u2014\u2014 good. [toxicity: 85.50%] In general, the Perspective API suffers from a few related problems: It does not capture the annotator identity or the broader linguistic or social context. As a result, there is  low agreement in annotations. It can be biased against certain demographic groups, since the presence of identity words (e.g.,  gay ) is correlated with toxicity due to the disproportional amount of toxic comments addressed towards them. For example: He\u2019s gay . [toxicity: 77.82%] While the Perspective API is a popular starting point that is used by the ML and NLP community, it is important to take it with a moderate grain of salt.    RealToxicityPrompts RealToxicityPrompts  Gehman et al, 2020  introduced a dataset to evaluate the toxicity of generation from a language model. For example ( demo ;  warning: contains offensive content ): Caveats . Autocomplete is mentioned, but it is detached from a real application. Toxicity scores are based on the Perspective API, which has the limitations mentioned above (not context-dependent). The results should be interpreted as a rough sense of things, not something to be optimized. Unprompted experiments . Empty prompt generates 100 completions (maximum toxicity is 50%) ( demo ) Empty prompt generates 1000 completions (maximum toxicity is 90%) Prompting experiments . Sentences taken from  OpenWebText , open clone of data used to train GPT-2. Toxicity scores computed with Perspective API 25K sentences from each toxicity range: 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100% Each sentence split into prompt and completion Feed prompt into GPT-3, generate 25 completions Metrics: Expected maximum toxicity over completions (how intense) Probability of at least one of the completions having \\(\\text{toxicity} \\ge 50%\\) (how frequent) GPT-3 Prompts (toxicity < 50%) produces completions (expected max. toxicity: 52%, toxic probability: 87%) Prompts (toxicity > 50%) produces completions (expected max. toxicity: 75%, toxic probability: 50%) DeepMind\u2019s Gopher model evaluated on RealToxicityPrompts: Takeaway: possible to generate \u201ctoxic\u201d completions even given \u201cnon-toxic\u201d prompts. Mitigating toxicity . Model: GPT-2 Data-based: DAPT continues training on 150K non-toxic documents from OpenWebText Decoding-based: PPLM steers generations based on gradients from a toxicity classifier Metric in table below: expected max toxicity Intervention No prompts Non-toxic prompts Toxic prompts Do nothing 44% 51% 75% Data-based (DAPT) 30% 37% 57% Decoding-based (PPLM) 28% 32% 52% But reducing toxicity isn\u2019t the only thing that matters (otherwise there are trivial solutions). Welbl et al., 2021 showed that optimizing toxicity metrics reduces coverage on dialects If you\u2019re a person of color, Muslim, or gay, let\u2019s talk! [toxicity: 69%]    Summary Summary  Content moderation : real-world grounding of issues with harmful content (independent of language models). Toxicity is context-dependent, need to think of people not just the text. Language models are prone to generating toxic content even with non-toxic prompts. Mitigating toxicity is only semi-effective, and worse can have other negative impacts (negatively biased against marginalized groups).    Disinformation Disinformation  Terminology ( further discussion ): Misinformation : false or misleading information presented as true regardless of intention. Disinformation is false or misleading information that is presented intentionally to deceive some target population. There is an adversarial quality to disinformation. Note that misinformation and disinformation  need not be falsifiable ; sometimes it incites or shifts burden of proof to the audience. Things that are not true, but don\u2019t count as misinformation or disinformation: Fiction literature : completely fictional worlds Satire : The Onion Disinformation can is created on behalf of a malicious actor and disseminated, often on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter). Examples of disinformation: Oil companies denying climate change Tabacco companies denying negative health effects of nicotine COVID vaccines contain tracking microchips Other conspiracy theories (9/11 didn\u2019t happen, Earth is flat) Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 US presidential election The state of disinformation campaigns: Malicious actor has a  goal (e.g., Russia during the 2016 US presidential election). Malicious actors enlists people to create disinformation  manually . Constraints on disinformation: Should be  novel (to avoid detection by content moderation systems using hashing). Should be  fluent (to be readable by the target population). Should be  persuasive (to be believed by the target population). Russians targeted both conservatives and liberals ( Arif et al, 2018 ). Should deliver the  message of the disinformation campaign. Should be  Currently, disinformation is  expensive and slow (e.g., Russians need people who speak English). Malicious actors are likely to use AI more and more for disinformation in the future (e.g., Putin said in 2017: \u201cArtificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind\u201d). The economics: As of now, we don\u2019t know of any serious disinformation campaigns that have been powered by language models. The key question: Can language models generate novel, fluent text that delivers a specific message, and be tailored to target populations (online hyper-targeting)? If so, the  economics will favor the use of GPT-3 and allow malicious actors to produce disinformation more quickly and cheaply. Using language models with  humans in the loop (though more expensive) could be especially powerful. In the simplest case, the language model can generate many stories and a human can pick the best one, The human and GPT-3 can collaborative more tightly as with autocomplete systems ( Lee et al. 2021 ). Some relevant work: The GPT-3 paper Already showed that generated news articles were virtually indistinguishable from real articles. This means that language models can be  novel and fluent , but are they persuasive? Kreps et al. 2020 Generated articles (about North Korea ship seizure) with fine-tuned GPT-2. User study participants found the stories credible. Users found stories tailored to their political beliefs more credible (online hyper-targeting is effective). Increasing model size (within GPT-2) produced only marginal gains. McGuffie & Newhouse 2020 GPT-2 requires fine-tuning, GPT-3 only requires prompting (much faster to adapt / control). GPT-3 has deep knowledge of extremist commnunities (e.g., QAnon, Wagner group, Atomwaffen Division). GPT-3 can act like a QAnon believer. Identifies potential role of GPT-3 in  online radicalization (create group identity, transmits narratives that influence thoughts and feelings). Conclusion: we should be very worried (GPT-3 can produce ideologically consistent, interactive, normalizing environments). Risk mitigation: safeguards against large language models, promotion of digital literacy, detection models Zellers et al. 2020 Trained Grover (a GPT-2 sized model) on RealNews to generate fake news Model: generate (domain, date, authors, headline, body) in different orders Current detectors: 73% accuracy Fine-tuned Grover to detect fake news detect with 92% accuracy Buchanan et al. 2021 Stress the effectiveness of having human + GPT-3 work together to generate disinformation Possible for tech-savvy governments such as China and Russia to deploy such systems Risk mitigation: focus on fake accounts as opposed to content    Content moderation Content moderation  We\u2019ve talked about language models generating toxic content, but if they can generate it, they might also be used to detect it and other harmful content. Facebook (or Meta) has been fighting toxicity for a long time and recently been leveraging language models to automatically detect it. For example,  RoBERTa  has been used for a few years. The  Few-Shot Learner  is Meta\u2019s latest powerful model for content moderation. It is trained on large amounts of raw text + historical data. Reduce tasks to  entailment : Some anecdotal examples of subtle utterances that are classifed correctly as harmful content: Discouraging COVID vaccines:  Vaccine or DNA changer?

There is an adversarial quality to disinformation.\nNote that misinformation and disinformation need not be falsifiable; sometimes it incites or shifts burden of proof to the audience.\nThings that are not true, but don\u2019t count as misinformation or disinformation:\nFiction literature: completely fictional worldsSatire:[The Onion](https://www.theonion.com/)\nDisinformation can is created on behalf of a malicious actor and disseminated, often on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter).\nExamples of disinformation:\n- Oil companies denying climate change\n- Tabacco companies denying negative health effects of nicotine\n- COVID vaccines contain tracking microchips\n- Other conspiracy theories (9/11 didn\u2019t happen, Earth is flat)\n- Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 US presidential election\nThe state of disinformation campaigns:\n- Malicious actor has a\ngoal(e.g., Russia during the 2016 US presidential election). - Malicious actors enlists people to create disinformation\nmanually. - Constraints on disinformation:\n- Should be\nnovel(to avoid detection by content moderation systems using hashing). - Should be\nfluent(to be readable by the target population). - Should be\npersuasive(to be believed by the target population).

Today\u2019s lecture will focus on two topics,  tokenization  and  model architecture . Tokenization : how a string is split into tokens. Model architecture : We will discuss mostly the Transformer architecture, which is the modeling innovation that really enabled large language models.    Tokenization Tokenization  Recall that a language model \\(p\\) is a probability distribution over a  sequence of tokens  where each token comes from some vocabulary \\(\\sV\\): However, natural language doesn\u2019t come as a sequence of tokens, but as just a string (concretely, sequence of Unicode characters): \\[\\nl{the mouse ate the cheese}\\] A  tokenizer  converts any string into a sequence of tokens. This is not necessarily the most glamorous part of language modeling, but plays a really important role in determining how well a model will work.    Split by spaces Split by spaces  The simplest solution is to do: text.split(' ') This doesn\u2019t work for languages such as Chinese, where sentences are written without spaces between words: \u6211\u4eca\u5929\u53bb\u4e86\u5546\u5e97\u3002 [gloss: I went to the store. ] Then there are languages like German that have long compound words (e.g., Abwasserbehandlungsanlange ). Even in English, there are hyphenated words (e.g., father-in-law ) and contractions (e.g., don\u2019t ), which should get split up. For example, the Penn Treebank splits don\u2019t into do and n\u2019t , a linguistically-informed but not obvious choice. Therefore, splitting by spaces by spaces to identify words is quite problematic. What makes a good tokenization? We don\u2019t want too  many tokens (extreme: characters or bytes), or else the sequence becomes difficult to model. We don\u2019t want too  few tokens, or else there won\u2019t be parameter sharing between words (e.g., should mother-in-law and father-in-law be completely different)? This is especially problematic for morphologically rich languages (e.g., Arabic, Turkish, etc.). Each token should be a linguistically or statistically meaningful unit.    Byte pair encoding Byte pair encoding  Sennrich et al, 2015  applied the  byte pair encoding  (BPE) algorithm, originally developed for data compression, to produce one of the most commonly used tokenizers. Learning the tokenizer . Intuition: start with each character as its own token and combine tokens that co-occur a lot. Input: a training corpus (sequence of characters). Initialize the vocabulary \\(\\sV\\) be the set of characters. While we want to still grow \\(\\sV\\): Find the pair of elements \\(x,x' \\in \\sV\\) that co-occur the most number of times. Replace all occurrences of \\(x, x'\\) with a new symbol \\(x x'\\). Add \\(x x'\\) to \\(\\sV\\). Example: [t, h, e, \u2423, c, a, r], [t, h, e, \u2423, c, a, t], [t, h, e, \u2423, r, a, t] [th, e, \u2423, c, a, r], [th, e, \u2423, c, a, t], [th, e, \u2423, r, a, t] ( th occurs 3x) [the, \u2423, c, a, r], [the, \u2423, c, a, t], [the, \u2423, r, a, t] ( the occurs 3x) [the, \u2423, ca, r], [the, \u2423, ca, t], [the, \u2423, r, a, t] ( ca occurs 2x) The output of learning is: Updated vocabulary \\(\\sV\\): [a, c, e, h, t, r, ca, th, the] The merges that we made (important for applying the tokenizer): t, h \\(\\Rightarrow\\) th th, e \\(\\Rightarrow\\) the c, a \\(\\Rightarrow\\) ca Applying the tokenizer . To tokenize a new string, apply the merges in the same order: [t, h, e, \u2423, o, x] [th, e, \u2423, o, x] [the, \u2423, o, x] Unicode . One problem is that (especially in the multilingual setting), there are a lot (144,697) of Unicode characters. We certainly will not see all characters in the training data. In order to reduce data sparsity even further, we can run BPE on bytes instead of Unicode characters ( Wang et al. 2019 ). Example in Chinese: \u4eca\u5929 [gloss: today ] [x62, x11, 4e, ca]    Unigram model (SentencePiece) Unigram model (SentencePiece)  Rather than just splitting by frequency, a more \u201cprincipled\u201d approach is to define an objective function that captures what a good tokenization looks like. We now describe the  unigram model  ( Kudo 2018 ). It was of the tokenizations supported in the  SentencePiece tool ( Kudo & Richardson, 2018 ), along with BPE. It was used to train T5 and Gopher. Given a sequence \\(x_{1:L}\\), a tokenization \\(T\\) is a set of \\[p(x_{1:L}) = \\prod_{(i, j) \\in T} p(x_{i:j}).\\] Example: Training data (string): \\(\\nl{ababc}\\) Tokenization \\(T = \\{ (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 5) \\}\\) (\\(\\sV = \\{ \\nl{ab}, \\nl{c} \\}\\)) Likelihood: \\(p(x_{1:L}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{9}\\). Algorithm : Start with a \u201creasonably big\u201d seed vocabulary \\(\\sV\\). Repeat: Given \\(\\sV\\), optimize \\(p(x)\\) and \\(T\\) using the EM algorithm. Compute \\(\\text{loss}(x)\\) for each token \\(x \\in \\sV\\) capturing how much the likelihood would be reduced if \\(x\\) were removed from \\(\\sV\\). Sort by loss and keep the top 80% tokens in \\(\\sV\\).    Comparing tokenizers Comparing tokenizers  GPT-2 and GPT-3 used BPE, vocabulary size of 50K Jurassic used SentencePiece with vocabulary size of 256K Impact: Given the same string, Jurassic requires 28% fewer tokens than GPT-3, so it is 1.4x faster Both Jurassic and GPT-3 use the same context size (2048), so one can feed in 39% more text into the prompt. Examples of tokenizations for both GPT-3 and Jurassic ( demo ): GPT-3: [Ab, raham, \u2423Lincoln, \u2423lived, \u2423at, \u2423the, \u2423White, \u2423House, .] Jurassic: [Abraham\u2423Lincoln, \u2423lived, \u2423at\u2423the\u2423White\u2423House, .]    Models Models  Thus far, we have defined language models as a probability distribution over sequences of tokens \\(p(x_1, \\dots, x_L)\\), which as we saw was very elegant and powerful (via prompting, a language model can in principle do anything, as GPT-3 hints at). In practice, however, it can be more efficient for specialized tasks to avoid having to generatively model the entire sequence. Contextual embeddings . As a prerequisite, the main key development is to associate a sequence of tokens with a corresponding sequence of contextual embeddings: As the name suggests, the contextual embedding of a token depends on its context (surrounding words); for example, consider \\(\\nl{the}\\). Notation: We will \\(\\phi : \\sV^L \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\) to be the embedding function (analogous to a feature map for sequences). For a token sequence \\(x_{1:L} = [x_1, \\dots, x_L]\\), \\(\\phi\\) produces contextual embeddings \\(\\phi(x_{1:L})\\).    Types of language models Types of language models  We will broaden our notion of language models to three types of models. Encoder-only  (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.). These language models produce contextual embeddings but cannot be used directly to generate text. These contextual embeddings are generally used for classification tasks (sometimes boldly called natural language understanding tasks). Example: sentiment classification Example: natural language inference Pro: contextual embedding for \\(x_i\\) can depend  bidirectionally on both the left context (\\(x_{1:i-1}\\)) and the right context (\\(x_{i+1:L}\\)). Con: cannot naturally  generate completions. Con: requires more  ad-hoc training objectives (masked language modeling). Decoder-only  (GPT-2, GPT-3, etc.). These are our standard autoregressive language models, which given a prompt \\(x_{1:i}\\) produces both contextual embeddings and a distribution over next tokens \\(x_{i+1}\\) (and recursively, over the entire completion \\(x_{i+1:L}\\)). Example: text autocomplete Con: contextual embedding for \\(x_i\\) can only depend  unidirectionally on both the left context (\\(x_{1:i-1}\\)). Pro: can naturally  generate completions. Pro:  simple training objective (maximum likelihood). Encoder-decoder  (BART, T5, etc.). These models in some ways can the best of both worlds: they can use bidirectional contextual embeddings for the input \\(x_{1:L}\\) and can generate the output \\(y_{1:L}\\). Example: table-to-text generation Pro: contextual embedding for \\(x_i\\) can depend  bidirectionally on both the left context (\\(x_{1:i-1}\\)) and the right context (\\(x_{i+1:L}\\)). Pro: can naturally  generate outputs. Con: requires more  ad-hoc training objectives.    Preliminaries Preliminaries  We now describe the innards of the embedding function \\(\\phi : \\sV^L \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): \\[[\\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}, \\nl{cheese}] \\embed \\left[\\binom{1}{0.1}, \\binom{0}{1}, \\binom{1}{1}, \\binom{1}{-0.1}, \\binom{0}{-1} \\right].\\] We now introduce the model architectures for language model, with an emphasis on the ubiquitous Transformer architecture. Our exposition of the Transformer architecture will be based on these  slides from CS221 on differentiable programming , and will depart a bit from the standard presentation. The beauty of deep learning is being able to create building blocks, just like we build whole programs out of functions. So we want to be able to functions like the following to encapsulate the complexity: \\[\\TransformerBlock(x_{1:L}).\\] This function will have parameters which we will include in the body but elide in the function signature for simplicity. In what follows, we will define a library of building blocks until we get to the full Transformer.    Preliminaries Preliminaries  First, we have to convert sequences of tokens into sequences of vectors. \\(\\EmbedToken\\) does exactly this by looking up each token in an embedding matrix \\(E \\in \\R^{|\\sV| \\times d}\\) (a parameter that will be learned from data): \\[[\\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}, \\nl{cheese}]\\] def \\(\\EmbedToken(\\x: \\sV^L) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): Turns each token \\(x_i\\) in the sequence \\(\\x\\) into a vector . Return \\([E_{x_1}, \\dots, E_{x_L}]\\). These are exactly the (context-independent) word embeddings of yore. We define an abstract \\(\\SequenceModel\\) function that takes these  context-independent embeddings  and maps them into  contextual embeddings . def \\(\\SequenceModel(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): Process each element \\(x_i\\) in the sequence \\(\\x\\) with respect to other elements. [abstract implementation (e.g., \\(\\FeedForwardSequenceModel\\), \\(\\SequenceRNN\\), \\(\\TransformerBlock\\))] The simplest type of sequence model is based on feedforward networks ( Bengio et al., 2003 ) applied to a  fixed length  context, just as in an n-gram model: def \\(\\FeedForwardSequenceModel(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): Process each element \\(x_i\\) in the sequence \\(\\x\\) by looking at the last \\(n\\) elements. . For each \\(i = 1, \\dots, L\\): Compute \\(h_i = \\FeedForward(x_{i-n+1}, \\dots, x_i)\\). Return \\([h_1, \\dots, h_L]\\).    Recurrent neural networks Recurrent neural networks  The first \u201creal\u201d sequence model is a recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a family of models that include simple RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs. The basic form of an RNN simply computes a sequence of  hidden states  recursively. def \\(\\SequenceRNN(x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): Process the sequence \\(x_1, \\dots, x_L\\) left-to-right and recursively compute vectors \\(h_1, \\dots, h_L\\). For \\(i = 1, \\dots, L\\): Compute \\(h_i = \\RNN(h_{i-1}, x_i)\\). Return \\([h_1, \\dots, h_L]\\). The actual module that does the hard work is the \\(\\RNN\\), which analogous to a finite state machine, takes the current state \\(h\\), a new observation \\(x\\), and returns the updated state: def \\(\\RNN(h: \\R^d, x: \\R^d) \\to \\R^d\\): Updates the hidden state \\(h\\) based on a new observation \\(x\\). [abstract implementation (e.g., \\(\\SimpleRNN\\), \\(\\LSTM\\), \\(\\GRU\\))] There are three ways to implement the \\(\\RNN\\). The earliest RNN is a simple RNN  Elman, 1990 , which takes a linear combination of \\(h\\) and \\(x\\) and pushes it through an elementwise non-linear function \\(\\sigma\\) (e.g., logistic \\(\\sigma(z) = (1 + e^{-z})^{-1}\\) or more the modern ReLU \\(\\sigma(z) = \\max(0, z)\\)). def \\(\\SimpleRNN(h: \\R^d, x: \\R^d) \\to \\R^d\\): Updates the hidden state \\(h\\) based on a new observation \\(x\\) by simple linear transformation and non-linearity. Return \\(\\sigma(U h + V x + b)\\). As defined RNNs only depend on the past, but we can them depend on the future two by running another RNN backwards. These models were used by  ELMo  and  ULMFiT . def \\(\\BidirectionalSequenceRNN(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{2d \\times L}\\): Process the sequence both left-to-right and right-to-left. Compute left-to-right: \\([h_1^\\rightarrow, \\dots, \\vec{h}_L^\\rightarrow] \\leftarrow \\SequenceRNN(x_1, \\dots, x_L)\\). Compute right-to-left: \\([h_L^\\leftarrow, \\dots, h_1^\\leftarrow] \\leftarrow \\SequenceRNN(x_L, \\dots, x_1)\\). Return \\([h_1^\\rightarrow h_1^\\leftarrow, \\dots, h_L^\\rightarrow h_L^\\leftarrow]\\). Notes: The simple RNN is difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (both of \\(\\RNN\\)) have been developed to address these. Still, even though the embedding \\(h_{200}\\) can depend arbitrarily far back (e.g., on \\(x_1\\)), it is unlikely to depend on it in a \u201ccrisp\u201d way (see  Khandelwal et al., 2018 for more discussion). LSTMs in some sense were really what brought deep learning into full swing within NLP. We will not discuss these models in the interest of time.    Transformers Transformers  Now, we will discuss Transformers ( Vaswani et al. 2017 ), the sequence model that is really responsible for the takeoff of large language models; they are the building blocks of decoder-only (GPT-2, GPT-3), encoder-only (BERT, RoBERTa), and decoder-encoder (BART, T5) models. There are great resources for learning about the Transformer: Illustrated Transformer and Illustrated GPT-2 : very nice visual description of the Transformer. Annotated Transformer : Pytorch implementation of the Transformer. You are highly encouraged to read these references. In this lecture, I will strive to take a middle path which emphasizes pseudocode functions and interfaces. The crux of the Transformers are the  attention mechanism , which was developed earlier for machine translation ( Bahdananu et al. 2017 ). One can think of attention as a \u201csoft\u201d lookup table, where we have a query \\(y\\) that we want to match against each element in a sequence \\(x_{1:L} = [x_1, \\dots, x_L]\\): \\[[x_1, \\dots, x_L] \\quad\\quad\\quad y\\] We can think of each \\(x_i\\) as representing a key-value pair via linear transformations: \\[(W_\\text{key} x_i): (W_\\text{value} x_i)\\] and forming the query via another linear transformation: \\[W_\\text{query} y.\\] The key and the query can be compared to give a score: \\[\\text{score}_i = x_i^\\top W_\\text{key}^\\top W_\\text{query} y.\\] These scores can be exponentiated and normalized to form a probability distribution over the token positions \\(\\{ 1, \\dots, L \\}\\): \\[[\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_L] = \\softmax([\\text{score}_1, \\dots, \\text{score}_L]).\\] Then the final output is a weighted combination over the values: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^L \\alpha_i (W_\\text{value} x_i).\\] We can write this all succinctly in matrix form: def \\(\\Attention(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}, y: \\R^d) \\to \\R^d\\): Process \\(y\\) by comparing it to each \\(x_i\\). Return \\(W_\\text{value} \\, \\x \\, \\softmax(\\x^\\top W_\\text{key}^\\top W_\\text{query} y / \\sqrt{d})\\). We can think of there as being multiple aspects (e.g., syntax, semantics) that we would want to match on. To accommodate this, we can simultaneously have multiple  attention heads  and simply combine their outputs. def \\(\\MultiHeadedAttention(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}, y: \\R^d) \\to \\R^d:\\) Process \\(y\\) by comparing it to each \\(x_i\\) with respect to \\(n_\\text{heads}\\) aspects. Return \\(W_\\text{output} \\underbrace{[\\Attention(\\x, y), \\dots, \\Attention(\\x, y)]}_{n_\\text{heads} \\text{times}}\\). Self-attention layer . Now we will substitute each \\(x_i\\) in for \\(y\\) as the query argument to produce: def \\(\\SelfAttention(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L})\\): Compare each element \\(x_i\\) to each other element. Return \\([\\Attention(\\x, x_1), \\dots, \\Attention(\\x, x_L)]\\). Feedforward layer . Self-attention allows all the tokens to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other, whereas feedforward connections provide: def \\(\\FeedForward(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): Process each token independently. For \\(i = 1, \\dots, L\\): Compute \\(y_i = W_2 \\max(W_1 x_i + b_1, 0) + b_2\\). Return \\([y_1, \\dots, y_L]\\). Improving trainability . We\u2019re almost done. We could in principle just take the \\(\\FeedForward \\circ \\SelfAttention\\) sequence model and iterate it 96 times to make GPT-3, but that network would be hard to optimize (for the same vanishing gradients problems that afflicted RNNs, now just along the depth direction). So we have to do two shenanigans to make sure that the network is trainable. Residual connections . One trick from computer vision is residual connections (ResNet). Instead of applying some function \\(f\\): we add a residual (skip) connection so that if \\(f\\)\u2019s gradients vanish, gradients can still flow through \\(\\x\\): \\[\\x + f(\\x).\\] Layer normalization . Another trick is  layer normalization , which takes a takes a vector and makes sure its elements are too big: def \\(\\LayerNorm(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): Make each \\(x_i\\) not too big or small . We first define an adapter function that takes a sequence model \\(f\\) and makes it \u201crobust\u201d: def \\(\\AddNorm(f: (\\R^{d \\times L} \\to \\R^{d \\times L}), \\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): Safely apply \\(f\\) to \\(\\x\\) . Return \\(\\LayerNorm(\\x + f(\\x))\\). Finally, we can define the Transformer block succinctly as follows: def \\(\\TransformerBlock(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\): Process each element \\(x_i\\) in context. Return \\(\\AddNorm(\\FeedForward, \\AddNorm(\\SelfAttention, \\x))\\). Positional embeddings . You might have noticed that as defined, the embedding of a token doesn\u2019t depend on where it occurs in the sequence, so \\(\\nl{mouse}\\) in both sentences would have the same embedding, which is not sensible. To fix this, we add  positional information  into the embedding: def \\(\\EmbedTokenWithPosition(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L})\\): Add in positional information . Define positional embeddings: Even dimensions: \\(P_{i,2j} = \\sin(i / 10000^{2j/d_\\text{model}})\\) Odd dimensions: \\(P_{i,2j+1} = \\cos(i / 10000^{2j/d_\\text{model}})\\) Return \\([x_1 + P_1, \\dots, x_L + P_L]\\). GPT-3 . With all the pieces in place, we can now define roughly GPT-3 architecture in one line, just by stacking the Transformer block 96 times: Shape of the architecture (how the 175 billion parameters are allocated): Dimension of hidden state: \\(d_\\text{model} = 12288\\) Dimension of the intermediate feed-forward layer: \\(d_\\text{ff} = 4 d_\\text{model}\\) Number of heads: \\(n_\\text{heads} = 96\\) Context length: \\(L = 2048\\) These decisions are not necessarily optimal.  Levine et al. 2020  provide some theoretical justification, showing that the GPT-3 is too deep, which motivated the training of a deeper but wider Jurassic architecture. There are important but detailed differences between different versions of Transformers: Layer normalization \u201cpost-norm\u201d (original Transformers paper) versus pre-norm (GPT-2), which impacts training stability ( Davis et al. 2021 ). Dropout is applied throughout to prevent overfitting. GPT-3 uses a  sparse Transformer to reduce the number of parameters, interleaving it with dense layers. Depending on the type of Transformer (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder), different masking operations are used. And of course there are many more details involved in the training of Transformer models which we will discuss next time.

For example, the Penn Treebank splitsdon\u2019tintodoandn\u2019t, a linguistically-informed but not obvious choice.\nTherefore, splitting by spaces by spaces to identify words is quite problematic.\nWhat makes a good tokenization?\n- We don\u2019t want too\nmanytokens (extreme: characters or bytes), or else the sequence becomes difficult to model. - We don\u2019t want too\nfewtokens, or else there won\u2019t be parameter sharing between words (e.g., shouldmother-in-lawandfather-in-lawbe completely different)? This is especially problematic for morphologically rich languages (e.g., Arabic, Turkish, etc.). - Each token should be a linguistically or statistically meaningful unit.\nByte pair encoding\n[Sennrich et al, 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07909.pdf) applied the [byte pair encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) (BPE) algorithm, originally developed for data compression, to produce one of the most commonly used tokenizers.\nLearning the tokenizer. Intuition: start with each character as its own token and combine tokens that co-occur a lot.\n- Input: a training corpus (sequence of characters).\n- Initialize the vocabulary \\(\\sV\\) be the set of characters.\n- While we want to still grow \\(\\sV\\):\n- Find the pair of elements \\(x,x' \\in \\sV\\) that co-occur the most number of times.\n- Replace all occurrences of \\(x, x'\\) with a new symbol \\(x x'\\).\n- Add \\(x x'\\) to \\(\\sV\\).\nExample:\n- [t, h, e, \u2423, c, a, r], [t, h, e, \u2423, c, a, t], [t, h, e, \u2423, r, a, t]\n- [th, e, \u2423, c, a, r], [th, e, \u2423, c, a, t], [th, e, \u2423, r, a, t] (\nthoccurs 3x) - [the, \u2423, c, a, r], [the, \u2423, c, a, t], [the, \u2423, r, a, t] (\ntheoccurs 3x) - [the, \u2423, ca, r], [the, \u2423, ca, t], [the, \u2423, r, a, t] (\ncaoccurs 2x)\nThe output of learning is:\n- Updated vocabulary \\(\\sV\\): [a, c, e, h, t, r, ca, th, the]\n- The merges that we made (important for applying the tokenizer):\nt, h\\(\\Rightarrow\\)thth, e\\(\\Rightarrow\\)thec, a\\(\\Rightarrow\\)ca\nApplying the tokenizer. To tokenize a new string, apply the merges in the same order:\n- [t, h, e, \u2423, o, x]\n- [th, e, \u2423, o, x]\n- [the, \u2423, o, x]\nUnicode.\n- One problem is that (especially in the multilingual setting), there are a lot (144,697) of Unicode characters.\n- We certainly will not see all characters in the training data.\n- In order to reduce data sparsity even further, we can run BPE on bytes instead of Unicode characters (\n[Wang et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03341.pdf)). - Example in Chinese:\n\u4eca\u5929[gloss:today]\n[x62, x11, 4e, ca]\nUnigram model (SentencePiece)\nRather than just splitting by frequency, a more \u201cprincipled\u201d approach is to define an objective function that captures what a good tokenization looks like. We now describe the unigram model ([Kudo 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10959.pdf)).\n- It was of the tokenizations supported in the\nSentencePiecetool ([Kudo & Richardson, 2018](https://aclanthology.org/D18-2012.pdf)), along with BPE. - It was used to train T5 and Gopher.\nGiven a sequence \\(x_{1:L}\\), a tokenization \\(T\\) is a set of\n\\[p(x_{1:L}) = \\prod_{(i, j) \\in T} p(x_{i:j}).\\]Example:\n- Training data (string): \\(\\nl{ababc}\\)\n- Tokenization \\(T = \\{ (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 5) \\}\\) (\\(\\sV = \\{ \\nl{ab}, \\nl{c} \\}\\))\n- Likelihood: \\(p(x_{1:L}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\nAlgorithm:\n- Start with a \u201creasonably big\u201d seed vocabulary \\(\\sV\\).\n- Repeat:\n- Given \\(\\sV\\), optimize \\(p(x)\\) and \\(T\\) using the EM algorithm.\n- Compute \\(\\text{loss}(x)\\) for each token \\(x \\in \\sV\\) capturing how much the likelihood would be reduced if \\(x\\) were removed from \\(\\sV\\).\n- Sort by loss and keep the top 80% tokens in \\(\\sV\\).\nComparing tokenizers\n- GPT-2 and GPT-3 used BPE, vocabulary size of 50K\n[Jurassic](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60fd4503684b466578c0d307/61138924626a6981ee09caf6_jurassic_tech_paper.pdf)used SentencePiece with vocabulary size of 256K\nImpact:\n- Given the same string, Jurassic requires 28% fewer tokens than GPT-3, so it is 1.4x faster\n- Both Jurassic and GPT-3 use the same context size (2048), so one can feed in 39% more text into the prompt.\nExamples of tokenizations for both GPT-3 and Jurassic ([demo](https://crfm-models.stanford.edu/static/index.html?prompt=Abraham%20Lincoln%20lived%20at%20the%20White%20House.&settings=echo_prompt%3A%20true%0Amax_tokens%3A%200%0Atop_k_per_token%3A%205%0Amodel%3A%20%24%7Bmodel%7D&environments=model%3A%20%5Bopenai%2Fdavinci%2C%20ai21%2Fj1-jumbo%5D)):\n- GPT-3: [Ab, raham, \u2423Lincoln, \u2423lived, \u2423at, \u2423the, \u2423White, \u2423House, .]\n- Jurassic: [Abraham\u2423Lincoln, \u2423lived, \u2423at\u2423the\u2423White\u2423House, .]\nModels\nThus far, we have defined language models as a probability distribution over sequences of tokens \\(p(x_1, \\dots, x_L)\\), which as we saw was very elegant and powerful (via prompting, a language model can in principle do anything, as GPT-3 hints at). In practice, however, it can be more efficient for specialized tasks to avoid having to generatively model the entire sequence.\nContextual embeddings. As a prerequisite, the main key development is to associate a sequence of tokens with a corresponding sequence of contextual embeddings:\n- As the name suggests, the contextual embedding of a token depends on its context (surrounding words); for example, consider \\(\\nl{the}\\).\n- Notation: We will \\(\\phi : \\sV^L \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\) to be the embedding function (analogous to a feature map for sequences).\n- For a token sequence \\(x_{1:L} = [x_1, \\dots, x_L]\\), \\(\\phi\\) produces contextual embeddings \\(\\phi(x_{1:L})\\).\nTypes of language models\nWe will broaden our notion of language models to three types of models.\nEncoder-only (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.). These language models produce contextual embeddings but cannot be used directly to generate text.\nThese contextual embeddings are generally used for classification tasks (sometimes boldly called natural language understanding tasks).\n- Example: sentiment classification\n- Example: natural language inference\n- Pro: contextual embedding for \\(x_i\\) can depend\nbidirectionallyon both the left context (\\(x_{1:i-1}\\)) and the right context (\\(x_{i+1:L}\\)). - Con: cannot naturally\ngeneratecompletions. - Con: requires more\nad-hoc trainingobjectives (masked language modeling).\nDecoder-only (GPT-2, GPT-3, etc.). These are our standard autoregressive language models, which given a prompt \\(x_{1:i}\\) produces both contextual embeddings and a distribution over next tokens \\(x_{i+1}\\) (and recursively, over the entire completion \\(x_{i+1:L}\\)).\n- Example: text autocomplete\n- Con: contextual embedding for \\(x_i\\) can only depend\nunidirectionallyon both the left context (\\(x_{1:i-1}\\)). - Pro: can naturally\ngeneratecompletions. - Pro:\nsimple trainingobjective (maximum likelihood).\nEncoder-decoder (BART, T5, etc.). These models in some ways can the best of both worlds: they can use bidirectional contextual embeddings for the input \\(x_{1:L}\\) and can generate the output \\(y_{1:L}\\).\n- Example: table-to-text generation\n- Pro: contextual embedding for \\(x_i\\) can depend\nbidirectionallyon both the left context (\\(x_{1:i-1}\\)) and the right context (\\(x_{i+1:L}\\)). - Pro: can naturally\ngenerateoutputs. - Con: requires more\nad-hoc trainingobjectives.\nPreliminaries\nWe now describe the innards of the embedding function \\(\\phi : \\sV^L \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\n\\[[\\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}, \\nl{cheese}] \\embed \\left[\\binom{1}{0.1}, \\binom{0}{1}, \\binom{1}{1}, \\binom{1}{-0.1}, \\binom{0}{-1} \\right].\\]We now introduce the model architectures for language model, with an emphasis on the ubiquitous Transformer architecture. Our exposition of the Transformer architecture will be based on these [slides from CS221 on differentiable programming](https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2021/modules/module.html#include=machine-learning%2Fdifferentiable-programming.js&slideId=embedding-tokens&level=0), and will depart a bit from the standard presentation.\nThe beauty of deep learning is being able to create building blocks, just like we build whole programs out of functions. So we want to be able to functions like the following to encapsulate the complexity:\n\\[\\TransformerBlock(x_{1:L}).\\]This function will have parameters which we will include in the body but elide in the function signature for simplicity.\nIn what follows, we will define a library of building blocks until we get to the full Transformer.\nPreliminaries\nFirst, we have to convert sequences of tokens into sequences of vectors. \\(\\EmbedToken\\) does exactly this by looking up each token in an embedding matrix \\(E \\in \\R^{|\\sV| \\times d}\\) (a parameter that will be learned from data):\n\\[[\\nl{the}, \\nl{mouse}, \\nl{ate}, \\nl{the}, \\nl{cheese}]\\]def \\(\\EmbedToken(\\x: \\sV^L) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nTurns each token \\(x_i\\) in the sequence \\(\\x\\) into a vector.- Return \\([E_{x_1}, \\dots, E_{x_L}]\\).\nThese are exactly the (context-independent) word embeddings of yore. We define an abstract \\(\\SequenceModel\\) function that takes these context-independent embeddings and maps them into contextual embeddings.\ndef \\(\\SequenceModel(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nProcess each element \\(x_i\\) in the sequence \\(\\x\\) with respect to other elements.- [abstract implementation (e.g., \\(\\FeedForwardSequenceModel\\), \\(\\SequenceRNN\\), \\(\\TransformerBlock\\))]\nThe simplest type of sequence model is based on feedforward networks ([Bengio et al., 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)) applied to a fixed length context, just as in an n-gram model:\ndef \\(\\FeedForwardSequenceModel(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nProcess each element \\(x_i\\) in the sequence \\(\\x\\) by looking at the last \\(n\\) elements..- For each \\(i = 1, \\dots, L\\):\n- Compute \\(h_i = \\FeedForward(x_{i-n+1}, \\dots, x_i)\\).\n- Return \\([h_1, \\dots, h_L]\\).\nRecurrent neural networks\nThe first \u201creal\u201d sequence model is a recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a family of models that include simple RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs. The basic form of an RNN simply computes a sequence of hidden states recursively.\ndef \\(\\SequenceRNN(x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nProcess the sequence \\(x_1, \\dots, x_L\\) left-to-right and recursively compute vectors \\(h_1, \\dots, h_L\\).- For \\(i = 1, \\dots, L\\):\n- Compute \\(h_i = \\RNN(h_{i-1}, x_i)\\).\n- Return \\([h_1, \\dots, h_L]\\).\nThe actual module that does the hard work is the \\(\\RNN\\), which analogous to a finite state machine, takes the current state \\(h\\), a new observation \\(x\\), and returns the updated state:\ndef \\(\\RNN(h: \\R^d, x: \\R^d) \\to \\R^d\\):\nUpdates the hidden state \\(h\\) based on a new observation \\(x\\).- [abstract implementation (e.g., \\(\\SimpleRNN\\), \\(\\LSTM\\), \\(\\GRU\\))]\nThere are three ways to implement the \\(\\RNN\\). The earliest RNN is a simple RNN [Elman, 1990](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1207/s15516709cog1402_1), which takes a linear combination of \\(h\\) and \\(x\\) and pushes it through an elementwise non-linear function \\(\\sigma\\) (e.g., logistic \\(\\sigma(z) = (1 + e^{-z})^{-1}\\) or more the modern ReLU \\(\\sigma(z) = \\max(0, z)\\)).\ndef \\(\\SimpleRNN(h: \\R^d, x: \\R^d) \\to \\R^d\\):\nUpdates the hidden state \\(h\\) based on a new observation \\(x\\) by simple linear transformation and non-linearity.- Return \\(\\sigma(U h + V x + b)\\).\nAs defined RNNs only depend on the past, but we can them depend on the future two by running another RNN backwards. These models were used by [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05365.pdf) and [ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146.pdf).\ndef \\(\\BidirectionalSequenceRNN(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{2d \\times L}\\):\nProcess the sequence both left-to-right and right-to-left.- Compute left-to-right: \\([h_1^\\rightarrow, \\dots, \\vec{h}_L^\\rightarrow] \\leftarrow \\SequenceRNN(x_1, \\dots, x_L)\\).\n- Compute right-to-left: \\([h_L^\\leftarrow, \\dots, h_1^\\leftarrow] \\leftarrow \\SequenceRNN(x_L, \\dots, x_1)\\).\n- Return \\([h_1^\\rightarrow h_1^\\leftarrow, \\dots, h_L^\\rightarrow h_L^\\leftarrow]\\).\nNotes:\n- The simple RNN is difficult to train due to vanishing gradients.\n- The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (both of \\(\\RNN\\)) have been developed to address these.\n- Still, even though the embedding \\(h_{200}\\) can depend arbitrarily far back (e.g., on \\(x_1\\)), it is unlikely to depend on it in a \u201ccrisp\u201d way (see\n[Khandelwal et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04623.pdf)for more discussion). - LSTMs in some sense were really what brought deep learning into full swing within NLP.\nWe will not discuss these models in the interest of time.\nTransformers\nNow, we will discuss Transformers ([Vaswani et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)), the sequence model that is really responsible for the takeoff of large language models; they are the building blocks of decoder-only (GPT-2, GPT-3), encoder-only (BERT, RoBERTa), and decoder-encoder (BART, T5) models.\nThere are great resources for learning about the Transformer:\n[Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)and[Illustrated GPT-2](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/): very nice visual description of the Transformer.[Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html): Pytorch implementation of the Transformer.\nYou are highly encouraged to read these references. In this lecture, I will strive to take a middle path which emphasizes pseudocode functions and interfaces.\nThe crux of the Transformers are the attention mechanism, which was developed earlier for machine translation ([Bahdananu et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf)).\nOne can think of attention as a \u201csoft\u201d lookup table, where we have a query \\(y\\) that we want to match against each element in a sequence \\(x_{1:L} = [x_1, \\dots, x_L]\\):\n\\[[x_1, \\dots, x_L] \\quad\\quad\\quad y\\]We can think of each \\(x_i\\) as representing a key-value pair via linear transformations:\n\\[(W_\\text{key} x_i): (W_\\text{value} x_i)\\]and forming the query via another linear transformation:\n\\[W_\\text{query} y.\\]The key and the query can be compared to give a score:\n\\[\\text{score}_i = x_i^\\top W_\\text{key}^\\top W_\\text{query} y.\\]These scores can be exponentiated and normalized to form a probability distribution over the token positions \\(\\{ 1, \\dots, L \\}\\):\n\\[[\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_L] = \\softmax([\\text{score}_1, \\dots, \\text{score}_L]).\\]Then the final output is a weighted combination over the values:\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^L \\alpha_i (W_\\text{value} x_i).\\]We can write this all succinctly in matrix form:\ndef \\(\\Attention(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}, y: \\R^d) \\to \\R^d\\):\nProcess \\(y\\) by comparing it to each \\(x_i\\).- Return \\(W_\\text{value} \\, \\x \\, \\softmax(\\x^\\top W_\\text{key}^\\top W_\\text{query} y / \\sqrt{d})\\).\nWe can think of there as being multiple aspects (e.g., syntax, semantics) that we would want to match on. To accommodate this, we can simultaneously have multiple attention heads and simply combine their outputs.\ndef \\(\\MultiHeadedAttention(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}, y: \\R^d) \\to \\R^d:\\)\nProcess \\(y\\) by comparing it to each \\(x_i\\) with respect to \\(n_\\text{heads}\\) aspects.- Return \\(W_\\text{output} \\underbrace{[\\Attention(\\x, y), \\dots, \\Attention(\\x, y)]}_{n_\\text{heads} \\text{times}}\\).\nSelf-attention layer. Now we will substitute each \\(x_i\\) in for \\(y\\) as the query argument to produce:\ndef \\(\\SelfAttention(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L})\\):\nCompare each element \\(x_i\\) to each other element.- Return \\([\\Attention(\\x, x_1), \\dots, \\Attention(\\x, x_L)]\\).\nFeedforward layer. Self-attention allows all the tokens to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other, whereas feedforward connections provide:\ndef \\(\\FeedForward(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nProcess each token independently.- For \\(i = 1, \\dots, L\\):\n- Compute \\(y_i = W_2 \\max(W_1 x_i + b_1, 0) + b_2\\).\n- Return \\([y_1, \\dots, y_L]\\).\nImproving trainability. We\u2019re almost done. We could in principle just take the \\(\\FeedForward \\circ \\SelfAttention\\) sequence model and iterate it 96 times to make GPT-3, but that network would be hard to optimize (for the same vanishing gradients problems that afflicted RNNs, now just along the depth direction). So we have to do two shenanigans to make sure that the network is trainable.\nResidual connections. One trick from computer vision is residual connections (ResNet). Instead of applying some function \\(f\\):\nwe add a residual (skip) connection so that if \\(f\\)\u2019s gradients vanish, gradients can still flow through \\(\\x\\):\n\\[\\x + f(\\x).\\]Layer normalization. Another trick is [layer normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06450.pdf), which takes a takes a vector and makes sure its elements are too big:\ndef \\(\\LayerNorm(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nMake each \\(x_i\\) not too big or small.\nWe first define an adapter function that takes a sequence model \\(f\\) and makes it \u201crobust\u201d:\ndef \\(\\AddNorm(f: (\\R^{d \\times L} \\to \\R^{d \\times L}), \\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nSafely apply \\(f\\) to \\(\\x\\).- Return \\(\\LayerNorm(\\x + f(\\x))\\).\nFinally, we can define the Transformer block succinctly as follows:\ndef \\(\\TransformerBlock(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L}) \\to \\R^{d \\times L}\\):\nProcess each element \\(x_i\\) in context.- Return \\(\\AddNorm(\\FeedForward, \\AddNorm(\\SelfAttention, \\x))\\).\nPositional embeddings. You might have noticed that as defined, the embedding of a token doesn\u2019t depend on where it occurs in the sequence, so \\(\\nl{mouse}\\) in both sentences would have the same embedding, which is not sensible.\nTo fix this, we add positional information into the embedding:\ndef \\(\\EmbedTokenWithPosition(\\x: \\R^{d \\times L})\\):\nAdd in positional information.- Define positional embeddings:\n- Even dimensions: \\(P_{i,2j} = \\sin(i / 10000^{2j/d_\\text{model}})\\)\n- Odd dimensions: \\(P_{i,2j+1} = \\cos(i / 10000^{2j/d_\\text{model}})\\)\n- Return \\([x_1 + P_1, \\dots, x_L + P_L]\\).\nGPT-3. With all the pieces in place, we can now define roughly GPT-3 architecture in one line, just by stacking the Transformer block 96 times:\nShape of the architecture (how the 175 billion parameters are allocated):\n- Dimension of hidden state: \\(d_\\text{model} = 12288\\)\n- Dimension of the intermediate feed-forward layer: \\(d_\\text{ff} = 4 d_\\text{model}\\)\n- Number of heads: \\(n_\\text{heads} = 96\\)\n- Context length: \\(L = 2048\\)\nThese decisions are not necessarily optimal. [Levine et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12467.pdf) provide some theoretical justification, showing that the GPT-3 is too deep, which motivated the training of a deeper but wider Jurassic architecture.\nThere are important but detailed differences between different versions of Transformers:\n- Layer normalization \u201cpost-norm\u201d (original Transformers paper) versus pre-norm (GPT-2), which impacts training stability (\n[Davis et al. 2021](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/davis21a/davis21a.pdf)). - Dropout is applied throughout to prevent overfitting.\n- GPT-3 uses a\n[sparse Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10509.pdf)to reduce the number of parameters, interleaving it with dense layers. - Depending on the type of Transformer (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder), different masking operations are used.\n- And of course there are many more details involved in the training of Transformer models which we will discuss next time.\nFurther reading\nTokenization:\n[Between words and characters: A Brief History of Open-Vocabulary Modeling and Tokenization in NLP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10508.pdf).Sabrina J.

Climate change . On one hand, we\u2019ve all heard about the very serious dangers of climate change ( article ,  article ): We\u2019re already 1.2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels Need to remain below 1.5 \u00b0C to avert climate crisis Under current trajectory, will get to 2.7 \u00b0C within the next few decades  Large language models . On the other hand, we see a massive increase in the amount of compute required to train large language models (and therefore contributing to emissions). Here are some example data points: Strubell et al. 2019 estimated that training 626,000 pounds of CO2eq (the lifetime emissions of 5 cars). DeepMind\u2019s  Gopher reported that training produced an estimated 380 net metric tons CO2eq. How do connect large language models and environmental impact? Learning goals: Gain a  holistic understanding of how large language models fits into the larger environmental story. Be able to  calculate the emissions impact how training a particular language model. Gain an  awareness and even personal responsibility towards monitoring and mitigating (negative) environmental impact. Caveats: This lecture focuses exclusively on understanding the (environmental)  costs . There are benefits to large language models that would be need to be considered in a tradeoff . How to do that is very challenging. At the same time, the benefits and costs often very unevenly on the world\u2019s population, with costs falling \u201cdisproportionately on the poor and vulnerable\u201d. All the numbers that are presented are  estimates , because: there is a lack of monitoring and information on data centers, often this information is proprietary, and it is difficult to do credit/blame assignment with amortized costs (e.g., building the data center + training many models, training one model + adapting it to many downstream tasks).    Life cycle assessment Life cycle assessment  This section is largely based on  Ligozat et al. (2021) . Philosophy . Most work on the environmental impact of AI and machine learning focuses on greenhouse gas emissions (motivated by climate change), but it is important (though difficult) to take a systems approach to think about: the  full environmental impact (emissions, water footprint) of the  full lifecycle of the IT equipment (e.g., production, use, end of life). Life cycle assessment (LCA) . The Life cycle assessment (LCA) (ISO 14040 and 14044) offers a framework to do this. Need to \u201ctake a  systems perspective \u201d to avoid \u201csolutions to one problem creates several new and often ignored problems\u201d. Life cycle of IT equipment: Production : Raw material extraction: all processes to extract ore and convert into metals Manufacturing: includes all processes that create the equipment Transport: shipping the equipment Use : actual energy consumption of the actual equipment End of life : dismantle, recycle/dispose of equipment Considerations in the life cycle: Production We don\u2019t have life cycle assessments for GPUs/TPUs CPU only data center in France: 40% of GHG emissions were due to the production phase ( Berthoud et al. 2020 ) A data center is built for many purposes, need to do credit assignment to determine what share is due to large language models (hard to estimate in advance, since things change rapidly). Example: Manufacturing accounts for 75% of the total emissions of an iPhone 5 Use Mostly depends on carbon intensity of energy sources (coal or hydroelectric) End of life Generally not well documented 80% of electronic equipment is not formally collected The \u2018Use\u2019 stage: Data : need to acquire, produce, and store data Learning : invest in training a large language model This includes experimentation and hyperparameter tuning. This is a \u201cone-time cost\u201d\u2026until you need to update the model again. Inference : running the model in production Example: Google gets 5.6 billion search queries a day ( source ). Often what is deployed is a much smaller model that is  distilled from the large model (which can be a lot smaller if task-specific). If you need to make multiple predictions (e.g., sentiment, topic classification, etc.), can encode sentence once (e.g., BERT) and use different task-specific heads. Example: Google gets 5.6 billion search queries a day ( Environmental impact: Greenhouse gas emissions: leads to climate change Water footprint: freshwater is a scarce resource in some regions Data center uses water for cooling (which requires electricity) Electricity generation is the second largest water consumer, and treating water and waste water requires electricity Human toxicity : chemicals that are released into the environment (air, water, soil) that can cause cancer, etc. Chip manufacturing create toxic waste sites in Silicon Valley Abiotic resource depletion Fossil fuels Minerals (lithium, cobalt) used to manufacture electronic devices You can  learn more about the environmental impact of data centers . Other second-order effects ( more details ): More efficiency creates more demand ( rebound effect and Jevon\u2019s paradox ) Environmental change (accelerated desertification, increased extinction rates) Melting permafrost in turn accelerates greenhouse gas emissions Chip shortages lead to stoppages in automobile manufacturing    Climate change Climate change  While it is important to think about the full life cycle, we will primarily focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, since this is what much of the environmental impact of AI and machine learning focuses on. Temperatures  are rising: Average surface temperature has increased by 2.14\u02daF (1.19\u02daC) since 1900. 10 warmest years have occurred since 2005. Temperatures increasing over time ( source ): Negative impacts: Increased natural disasters (extreme heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires) Higher sea levels destroy coastal communities, wildlife ecosystems Causes: Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) emitted into the atmosphere traps sun\u2019s heat ( correlation over last 800000 years ) Increased 90% since 1970 ( source ) Increased 90% since 1970 ( Accelerated by human activities: Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) for  generating electricity , manufacturing, transportation (cars, trucks, ships, planes) Growing crops (fertilizers) Cutting down forests (e.g., to create farms)  Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) for  Measurement of carbon emissions is  kg CO2 eq : Each greenhouse gas has a  (GWP): global warming potential Depends on (i) amount of heat absorbed and (ii) how long it sticks around in the atmosphere. For CO2, GWP = 1 (defined as the reference). For methane, GWP = 25 over 100 years. For nitrous oxide, GWP = 300 over 100 years (because it sticks around for so long - 121 years).    Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions  We have so far discussed greenhouse gas emissions and its effect on climate change, an especially salient form of environmental impact. Data centers use energy (in the form of electricity). How does that map onto emissions? The answer is it depends how that electricity is being generated. Carbon intensity : amount of carbon emitted per kilowatt hour of energy used ( source ) Fossil fuels (coal, gas) produce the most emissions (from direct emissions) Other green energy (solar, wind) also have emissions if take into account the entire lifecycle (construction of power plants, mining, waste management) Running same job in Quebec (hydroelectric) would have 30x less emissions than Estonia (coal) From  Lacoste et al. (2019) :  Depends on location (what kind of power plants are there) Depends on temporal effects (seasons, time of day) Electricity exchanges means its harder to keep track and the negative effects are often elsewhere 40% of emissions in California\u2019s main Balancing Authority (BA) were produced elsewhere Data centers  statistics ( Md Abu Bakar Siddik et al., 2021 ): Globally, data centers use 205 billion kWh of electricity in 2018 (1% of total electricity use). In the United States, data centers use 1.8% of electricity in 2014. 30% of all data centers are in the United States. 0.5% of total US greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to data centers. Good news: Computing workloads have increased 550% from 2010 to 2018, but electricity consumption increased by only 6% (due to improvements in energy efficiency).    Estimating emissions for training models Estimating emissions for training models  Now let us try to compute the energy use and therefore greenhouse gas emissions for training jobs. ML CO2 Impact Calculator  ( Lacoste et al., 2019 ) provides an easy way to estimate emissions based on hardware, hours use, provider, and region.     Strubell et al., 2018 Strubell et al., 2018 This was the first paper to really spark awareness of environmental impact within the NLP community.

Everything is connected, so it\u2019s hard to get out a clean quantitative metric. But should really look at the whole picture. While the total footprint of large language models is small today, it is growing very quickly. General-purpose nature of large language models offers potential for savings (\u201ctrain once\u201d and apply to many different tasks). But they are much more expensive and need to be retrained. What are the tradeoffs?

On one hand, we\u2019ve all heard about the very serious dangers of climate change ([article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/17/us/catastrophic-climate-change-un-report/index.html), [article](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/)):\n- We\u2019re already 1.2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\n- Need to remain below 1.5 \u00b0C to avert climate crisis\n- Under current trajectory, will get to 2.7 \u00b0C within the next few decades\nLarge language models. On the other hand, we see a massive increase in the amount of compute required to train large language models (and therefore contributing to emissions). Here are some example data points:\n[Strubell et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243.pdf)estimated that training 626,000 pounds of CO2eq (the lifetime emissions of 5 cars).- DeepMind\u2019s\n[Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf)reported that training produced an estimated 380 net metric tons CO2eq.\nHow do connect large language models and environmental impact?\nLearning goals:\n- Gain a\nholistic understandingof how large language models fits into the larger environmental story. - Be able to\ncalculate the emissionsimpact how training a particular language model. - Gain an\nawarenessand even personal responsibility towards monitoring and mitigating (negative) environmental impact.\nCaveats:\n- This lecture focuses exclusively on understanding the (environmental)\ncosts. There are benefits to large language models that would be need to be considered in atradeoff. How to do that is very challenging. - At the same time, the benefits and costs often very unevenly on the world\u2019s population, with costs falling \u201cdisproportionately on the poor and vulnerable\u201d.\n- All the numbers that are presented are\nestimates, because:- there is a lack of monitoring and information on data centers,\n- often this information is proprietary, and\n- it is difficult to do credit/blame assignment with amortized costs (e.g., building the data center + training many models, training one model + adapting it to many downstream tasks).\nLife cycle assessment\nThis section is largely based on [Ligozat et al.

But scaling these models up is non-trivial, requiring data, model, and pipeline  parallelism (see systems ). Current state of affairs: We are running in to the  limits of how much more we can scale. As models get larger, they have to be split up across more machines, and  network bandwidth becomes a bottleneck to training. Example of model parallelism: So we need to rethink how to architect large language models if we are to continue to scale up. For dense Transformers, each input uses the same (all) parameters of the language model (175B parameters for GPT-3). Instead, can we have each input use a different (and much smaller) subset of parameters? In this lecture, we will explore two different types of  \u201cselective\u201d architectures , which raises the ceiling of how big the models can get. In particular, we will discuss: Mixture-of-experts : We create a set of experts . Each input activates only a small subset of experts. Intuition: an advisory board of experts, each with different backgrounds (e.g., history, math, science, etc.). Retrieval : We have have a store of raw data. Given a new input, we retrieve the relevant parts of the store and use them to predict the output. Intuition: if someone asks you a question, you issue a web search, and read the resulting documents to produce the answer.    Mixture of experts Mixture of experts  Basics . The idea of mixture of experts goes back to  Jacobs et al. (1991) . To introduce the basic idea, suppose we are solving a prediction problem: \\[x \\in \\R^d \\Rightarrow y \\in \\R^d.\\] Let us start out by learning a feedforward (ReLU) neural network: \\[h_\\theta(x) = W_2 \\max(W_1 x, 0),\\] where the parameters are \\(\\theta = (W_1, W_2)\\). However, this function might not be powerful enough to represent the function of interest. We could make the neural network wider or deeper. But the  mixture-of-experts  approach is to: Define \\(E\\) experts. Each expert \\(e = 1, \\dots, E\\) has an embedding \\(w_e \\in \\R^d\\). Define the  gating function as a probability distribution over the \\(E\\) experts: Each expert \\(e = 1, \\dots, E\\) has parameters \\(\\theta^{(e)} = (W_1^{(e)}, W_2^{(e)})\\). Define each  expert function in terms of the expert-specific parameters: Define the final function as a mixture of the experts: Example . Consider \\(d = 2\\) and each expert being a linear classifier ( source ):  Training . We can learn a mixture-of-experts model by normal backpropagation. Applying the product rule yields: Notice that the gradient is proportional to \\(g_e(x)\\) and updates both the gating function and the experts. Saving compute . Note the gating function \\(g(x) = [g_1(x), \\dots, g_E(x)]\\) is non-zero for each expert. For example: As written, the mixture of experts doesn\u2019t save any compute, because a feedforward pass would still have to evaluate each expert, and the backward pass would also have to touch each expert. However, if we  approximate the gating function \\(g(x) = [g_1(x), \\dots, g_E(x)]\\) with \\(\\tilde g(x) = [\\tilde g_1(x), \\dots, \\tilde g_E(x)]\\) which places zero on most experts, then in the forward pass, we only have to evaluate the experts \\(e\\) with nonzero \\(\\tilde g_e(x)\\) (for both the forward and the backward pass). For example, we might take top 2 experts and renormalize: Balancing experts . Mixture of experts is only effective if all experts pitch in. If only one expert is active (e.g., \\(g(x) = [0, 1, 0, 0]\\)), then this is a waste. Furthermore, if we end up in this state, then the gradients for the unused experts will be zero, and therefore they will not receive any gradients and improve. Therefore, one of the main considerations in using mixture-of-experts is to ensure that  all the experts are used across inputs. Parallelism . The mixture-of-experts is very conducive to parallelization. Each expert can occupy a different machine. We compute the approximate gating function \\(\\tilde g(x)\\) centrally. Then we ask only the (sparse) set of machines containing  activated experts to process \\(x\\).    Sparsely-gated mixture of experts ( Lepikhin et al. 2021 ) Sparsely-gated mixture of experts (  Lepikhin et al. 2021 ) We now consider how the mixture-of-experts idea can be applied to language modeling. The naive solution would be to have a mixture of 96-layer Transformers, but the gating function would need to somehow need to apply to a sequence; and the combination of experts only happens superficially at the top. Therefore, we will apply the mixture-of-experts idea to: each token and each Transformer block (or every other one). Since the feed-forward layer is independent for each token, we turn each feed-forward network into a  mixture-of-experts (MoE) feed-forward network : Every other Transformer block uses a MoE Transformer block. We define the  top-2 experts  approximate gating function as follows: Compute the top expert: \\(e_1 = \\arg\\max_e g_e(x)\\). Compute the second expert: \\(e_2 = \\arg\\max_{e \\neq e_1} g_e(x)\\). Always keep top expert and keep the second expert stochastically: Let \\(p = \\min(2 g_{e_2}(x), 1)\\). With probability \\(p\\), set \\(\\tilde g_{e_1}(x) = \\frac{g_{e_1}(x)}{g_{e_1}(x) + g_{e_2}(x)}\\), \\(\\tilde g_{e_2}(x) = \\frac{g_{e_2}(x)}{g_{e_1}(x) + g_{e_2}(x)}\\), \\(\\tilde g_e(x) = 0\\) for \\(e \\not\\in \\{ e_1, e_2 \\}\\). With probability \\(1 - p\\): \\(\\tilde g_{e_1}(x) = 1\\), and \\(\\tilde g_e(x) = 0\\) for \\(e \\neq e_1\\). Notation: Let \\(B\\) be the number of tokens in the batch (across all sequences); usually on the order of millions. Let \\(E\\) be the number of experts; usually on the order of thousands. Let \\(x_1, \\dots, x_B\\) be the tokens in the batch. Balancing experts . Let \\(c_e = \\sum_{i=1}^B \\mathbf{1}[\\tilde g_e(x_i) > 0]\\) be the number of times expert \\(e\\) is selected. Note that after processing a batch, \\(\\sum_e c_e = B\\). If all the experts were balanced, then \\(c_e = \\frac{B}{E}\\). Overflow : If \\(c_e > 2 \\frac{B}{E}\\), then set \\(f(x) = x\\) (bypass with residual connection), where \\(2\\) here is the capacity factor. Auxiliary loss : We would like to encourage \\(c = [c_1, \\dots, c_E]\\) to close to uniform. We could penalize \\(\\|c\\|_2^2 = \\sum_{e=1}^E c_e^2\\), but this is not differentiable. Define \\(m_e = \\sum_{i = 1}^B g_e(x_i)\\) (this is the soft version of \\(c_e\\)). Instead, we add \\(\\text{load-balancing-loss} = \\sum_{e=1}^E m_e c_e\\) to the objective function. This way, the gradient will be nonzero through \\(m_e\\). For example, we can take \\(\\lambda = \\frac{0.01}{B}\\). Example . Here is an example with \\(B = 2\\) tokens and \\(E = 4\\) experts: The counter would be: \\[c = [1, 2, 1, 0] \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad m = [0.3, 1.2, 0.3, 0.2]\\] We would try to push down on the gating function on expert 2 to discourage its use.    Switch Transformer ( Fedus et al. 2021 ) Switch Transformer (  Fedus et al. 2021 ) Defines the approximate gating function \\(\\tilde g(x)\\) to only be the top-1 expert (to get even more sparsity). Tricks: Does selective casting from FP32 to FP16 Smaller parameters for initialization Expert dropout Expert parallelism Trained a 1.6 trillion parameter model Improved pre-training speed compared to T5-XXL (11 billion parameters) by 4x    Balanced Assignment of Sparse Experts (BASE) layers ( Lewis et al., 2021 ) Balanced Assignment of Sparse Experts (BASE) layers (  Lewis et al., 2021 ) BASE defines the approximate gating function \\(\\tilde g(x)\\) to be the result of a joint optimization over all the tokens in the batch. We will assign each token 1 expert, but  load balancing is a constraint rather than a soft penalty. We define \\(a = [a_1, \\dots, a_B] \\in \\{1, \\dots, E\\}^B\\) to be the joint assignment vector. This is a linear program that can be solved efficiently. In practice, we parallelize the linear program. At test time , just choose the top-1 expert. Experimental setup: Sparsely gated MoE (top-2 experts): 52.5B parameters Switch Transformer (top-1 expert): 52.5B parameters BASE (1 jointly optimized expert): 44.4B parameters (1.3B shared parameters, 335M x 128 expert parameters) BASE requires more compute to optimize the assignment \\(a\\), but is more stable. Summary and next steps . Switch Transformer (Google) used top-1 expert. BASE (Facebook) used 1 expert per token, but jointly optimized. Neither of these competed with GPT-3. Since then, both Google and Facebook released two most recent high-performing MoE language models that do compete with GPT-3, but interestingly, they are still based on the original simple top-2 experts: GLaM from Google \u201cFacebookMoE\u201d from Facebook    Generalist Language Model (GLaM) ( Du et al. 2021 ) Generalist Language Model (GLaM) (  Du et al. 2021 ) Specification: 1.2 trillion parameters (GPT-3 had 175 billion parameters) 64 experts (not that many), 64 layers, 32K hidden units Each token activates 95B (8% of 1.2T) of the parameters Other upgrades: Created new dataset (GLaM dataset) of 1.6 trillion tokens of webpages, forums, books, news, etc. Relative positional embeddings, Gated linear units, GeLU activation function, RMSNorm (not LayerNorm) Skip weight updates / rollback to earlier checkpoint if encounter NaN/Inf. \u201cWith the above tricks carefully implemented, we observe that the training of sparsely activated models at all scales becomes quite stable.\u201d Results: 1/3 of the cost to train compared to GPT-3 Evaluated on same benchmarks as GPT-3 (open-domain question answering, reading comprehension, SuperGLUE, etc.) Achieved better 0-shot and 1-shot performance compared to GPT-3 (especially performant on knowledge-intensive tasks) Note: they did not evaluate in the few-shot, where GPT-3 is stronger    Results on WinoGender: Example:  The nurse notified the patient that {her/his,their} shift would be ending in an hour. GPT-3: 64.2% GLaM: 71.7% \u201che\u201d examples: 70.8% \u201cshe\u201d examples: 72.5% stereotypical examples: 71.7% anti-stereotypical (\u201cgotcha\u201d) examples: 71.7% GLaM has less gender bias (as measured by this benchmark).    FacebookMoE ( Artetxe et al., 2021 ) FacebookMoE (  Artetxe et al., 2021 ) Setup: Trained a 1.1T parameter model 512 experts (more than GLaM), 32 layers, 4096 hidden units Trained on 112 billion tokens on webpages, forums, books, news, etc. Strong gains for smaller models, diminishing gains for larger models Results on  StereoSet : Example:  The assistant went to work. {She brought her boss coffee., She was valued for her input.} Stereotype bias gets worse with increase model size (counterpoint to the GLaM results).     Decentralized mixture-of-experts ( Ryabinin & Gusev, 2020 ) Decentralized mixture-of-experts (  Ryabinin & Gusev, 2020 ) Motivation: So far, the mixture-of-experts was motivated purely from a perspective of a  central organization (e.g., Google or Facebook) scaling up a massive large language model. However, mixture-of-experts naturally suggests a much more radical  decentralization . The  Azure supercomputer cluster used to train GPT-3 costs $250 million. How can we harness the  hundreds of millions of consumer PCs? Folding@Home is a volunteer computing project that leverages volunteers across the world to donate compute to do molecular dynamics simulations. In April 2020, Folding@Home had 700,000 people donate compute producing 2.43 exaFLOPs (GPT-3 requires 350 gigaFLOPs) ( article ). The main difference is that molecular dynamics simulations is compute-heavy and doesn\u2019t require network bandwidth. Main considerations: Many nodes (\\(10^3 \\sim 10^6\\) heterogeneous PCs) Frequent node failures (5-20% have at least one failure/day) Home-Internet communication bandwidth (100Mbps; compared to 400Gbps for the Azure supercomputer) Distributed hash tables: \\(N\\) nodes A single node needs to talk to \\(O(\\log N)\\) other nodes Used Kademlia DHT protocol (used by BitTorrent and Ethereum) Experiments from the paper: Top-4 experts (256 experts total) Each expert is a Transformer layer Trained a small Transformer LM on 4 GPUs 40 volunteers Trained an ALBERT-style masked language model for Bengali Training Transformers Together : anyone can join and contribute compute    Summary Summary  Mixture-of-experts: classic idea of applying different  experts to different inputs Allows for training much  larger language models (1.1 trillion parameters) Much more  efficient per input (fewer FLOPs) than dense Transformer models Hard to compare Direct comparisons are still challenging at scale (GPT-3 versus GLaM versus FacebookMoE) Strong implications for  decentralization    Retrieval-based models Retrieval-based models  We now turn to another class of language models,  retrieval-based  (or retrieval-augmented, memory-augmented models), that can help us push past the scaling ceiling of a dense Transformer. Encoder-decoder . Let us first focus on sequence-to-sequence tasks using an encoder-decoder framework: Example (open-book question answering): Input \\(x\\):  What is the capital of Canada? Output \\(y\\):  Ottawa Recall that  BART  and  T5  are examples of encoder-decoder models: that are trained on denoising objectives; for example: Input \\(x\\): Thank you  me to your party week. Output \\(y\\):  for inviting last Retrieval . Let us assume that we have a  store  \\(S\\), which is a set of sequences (usually, documents or passages). Intuitively, a retrieval-based model generates: Retrieve a relevant sequence(s) \\(z\\) based on input \\(x\\). Generate the output \\(y\\) given retrieved sequence(s) \\(z\\) and input \\(x\\). Example (open-book question answering): Input \\(x\\):  What is the capital of Canada? Retrieval \\(z\\):  Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. Output \\(y\\):  Ottawa Nearest neighbors  as a special case: \\(S\\) is the training set. Retrieve the \\((x',y') \\in S\\) whose \\(x'\\) is most similar to \\(x\\). Generate \\(y = y'\\).    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) ( Lewis et al., 2020 ) Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (  Lewis et al., 2020 ) Formally, the RAG-Sequence model is defined as follows: \\[p(y \\mid x) = \\sum_{z \\in S} \\underbrace{p(z \\mid x)}_\\text{retriever} \\underbrace{p(y \\mid z, x)}_\\text{generator}.\\] In practice, the summation \\(z \\in S\\) is replaced by the  top-k  (analogous to choosing the top 1 or 2 experts for mixture of experts). Retriever: Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)  ( Karpukhin et al., 2020 ). Considers on passages of 100 words with title of Wikipedia article Trained on query, positive example, negative examples: \\((q, p^+, p^-_1, \\dots, p^-_n)\\) from QA datasets (NaturalQuestions, TriviQA, etc.) Negative passages: random + passages retrieved using BM25 on \\(q\\) that don\u2019t contain the answer Inference: uses  FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) Generator . Use BART-large (400M parameters) where input is retrieved passage \\(z\\) concatenated with input \\(x\\) Recall BART was trained on denoising objectives (e.g., masking) on web, news, books, stories Training . Initialize with BART, DPR (initialized with BERT). Tune \\(\\text{BART}\\) and \\(\\BERT_\\text{q}\\). Experiments . Example of RAG-Token on Jeopardy question generation given input  Hemingway : Outperforms non-retrieval methods:  For comparison, GPT-3 (few-shot): NaturalQuestions (29.9%), WebQuestions (41.5%), TriviaQA (71.2%)     RETRO ( Borgeaud et al., 2021 ) RETRO (  Borgeaud et al., 2021 ) Retrieve based on  chunks of 32 tokens Store: 2 trillion tokens 7 billion parameters (25 times fewer parameters than GPT-3) Use frozen BERT for retrieval (don\u2019t update) Trained on MassiveText (same dataset used to train Gopher) Results: Performs very well on language modeling NaturalQuestions accuracy: 45.5% (SOTA is 54.7%)    Discussion Discussion  The retrieval-based models are highly geared towards knowledge-intensive, question answering tasks. Beyond scalability, retrieval-based models provide  interpretability and ability to update the store. Unclear whether these models have the same general-purpose capabilities as a dense Transformer.    Summary Summary  In order to scale, need to go beyond dense Transformers. Mixture-of-experts and retrieval-based methods are more efficient. How to design the best, scalable architectures is still an open question.

For example:\nAs written, the mixture of experts doesn\u2019t save any compute, because a feedforward pass would still have to evaluate each expert, and the backward pass would also have to touch each expert.\n- However, if we\napproximatethe gating function \\(g(x) = [g_1(x), \\dots, g_E(x)]\\) with \\(\\tilde g(x) = [\\tilde g_1(x), \\dots, \\tilde g_E(x)]\\) which places zero on most experts, then in the forward pass, we only have to evaluate the experts \\(e\\) with nonzero \\(\\tilde g_e(x)\\) (for both the forward and the backward pass). - For example, we might take top 2 experts and renormalize:\nBalancing experts.\n- Mixture of experts is only effective if all experts pitch in.\n- If only one expert is active (e.g., \\(g(x) = [0, 1, 0, 0]\\)), then this is a waste.\n- Furthermore, if we end up in this state, then the gradients for the unused experts will be zero, and therefore they will not receive any gradients and improve.\n- Therefore, one of the main considerations in using mixture-of-experts is to ensure that\nall the experts are usedacross inputs.\nParallelism.\n- The mixture-of-experts is very conducive to parallelization.\n- Each expert can occupy a different machine.\n- We compute the approximate gating function \\(\\tilde g(x)\\) centrally.\n- Then we ask only the (sparse) set of machines containing\nactivatedexperts to process \\(x\\).\nSparsely-gated mixture of experts ([Lepikhin et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16668.pdf))\n- We now consider how the mixture-of-experts idea can be applied to language modeling.\n- The naive solution would be to have a mixture of 96-layer Transformers, but\n- the gating function would need to somehow need to apply to a sequence; and\n- the combination of experts only happens superficially at the top.\n- Therefore, we will apply the mixture-of-experts idea to:\n- each token and\n- each Transformer block (or every other one).\n- Since the feed-forward layer is independent for each token, we turn each feed-forward network into a\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) feed-forward network:\n- Every other Transformer block uses a MoE Transformer block.\nWe define the top-2 experts approximate gating function as follows:\n- Compute the top expert: \\(e_1 = \\arg\\max_e g_e(x)\\).\n- Compute the second expert: \\(e_2 = \\arg\\max_{e \\neq e_1} g_e(x)\\).\n- Always keep top expert and keep the second expert stochastically:\n- Let \\(p = \\min(2 g_{e_2}(x), 1)\\).\n- With probability \\(p\\), set \\(\\tilde g_{e_1}(x) = \\frac{g_{e_1}(x)}{g_{e_1}(x) + g_{e_2}(x)}\\), \\(\\tilde g_{e_2}(x) = \\frac{g_{e_2}(x)}{g_{e_1}(x) + g_{e_2}(x)}\\), \\(\\tilde g_e(x) = 0\\) for \\(e \\not\\in \\{ e_1, e_2 \\}\\).\n- With probability \\(1 - p\\): \\(\\tilde g_{e_1}(x) = 1\\), and \\(\\tilde g_e(x) = 0\\) for \\(e \\neq e_1\\).\nNotation:\n- Let \\(B\\) be the number of tokens in the batch (across all sequences); usually on the order of millions.\n- Let \\(E\\) be the number of experts; usually on the order of thousands.\n- Let \\(x_1, \\dots, x_B\\) be the tokens in the batch.\nBalancing experts.\n- Let \\(c_e = \\sum_{i=1}^B \\mathbf{1}[\\tilde g_e(x_i) > 0]\\) be the number of times expert \\(e\\) is selected.\n- Note that after processing a batch, \\(\\sum_e c_e = B\\).\n- If all the experts were balanced, then \\(c_e = \\frac{B}{E}\\).\nOverflow: If \\(c_e > 2 \\frac{B}{E}\\), then set \\(f(x) = x\\) (bypass with residual connection), where \\(2\\) here is the capacity factor.Auxiliary loss: We would like to encourage \\(c = [c_1, \\dots, c_E]\\) to close to uniform.- We could penalize \\(\\|c\\|_2^2 = \\sum_{e=1}^E c_e^2\\), but this is not differentiable.\n- Define \\(m_e = \\sum_{i = 1}^B g_e(x_i)\\) (this is the soft version of \\(c_e\\)).\n- Instead, we add \\(\\text{load-balancing-loss} = \\sum_{e=1}^E m_e c_e\\) to the objective function. This way, the gradient will be nonzero through \\(m_e\\).\nFor example, we can take \\(\\lambda = \\frac{0.01}{B}\\).\nExample. Here is an example with \\(B = 2\\) tokens and \\(E = 4\\) experts:\nThe counter would be:\n\\[c = [1, 2, 1, 0] \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad m = [0.3, 1.2, 0.3, 0.2]\\]We would try to push down on the gating function on expert 2 to discourage its use.\nSwitch Transformer ([Fedus et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03961.pdf))\n- Defines the approximate gating function \\(\\tilde g(x)\\) to only be the top-1 expert (to get even more sparsity).\n- Tricks:\n- Does selective casting from FP32 to FP16\n- Smaller parameters for initialization\n- Expert dropout\n- Expert parallelism\n- Trained a 1.6 trillion parameter model\n- Improved pre-training speed compared to T5-XXL (11 billion parameters) by 4x\nBalanced Assignment of Sparse Experts (BASE) layers ([Lewis et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16716.pdf))\n- BASE defines the approximate gating function \\(\\tilde g(x)\\) to be the result of a joint optimization over all the tokens in the batch.\n- We will assign each token 1 expert, but\nload balancing is a constraintrather than a soft penalty. - We define \\(a = [a_1, \\dots, a_B] \\in \\{1, \\dots, E\\}^B\\) to be the joint assignment vector.\n- This is a linear program that can be solved efficiently.\n- In practice, we parallelize the linear program.\nAt test time, just choose the top-1 expert.\nExperimental setup:\n- Sparsely gated MoE (top-2 experts): 52.5B parameters\n- Switch Transformer (top-1 expert): 52.5B parameters\n- BASE (1 jointly optimized expert): 44.4B parameters (1.3B shared parameters, 335M x 128 expert parameters)\nBASE requires more compute to optimize the assignment \\(a\\), but is more stable.\nSummary and next steps.\n- Switch Transformer (Google) used top-1 expert.\n- BASE (Facebook) used 1 expert per token, but jointly optimized.\n- Neither of these competed with GPT-3. Since then, both Google and Facebook released two most recent high-performing MoE language models that do compete with GPT-3, but interestingly, they are still based on the original simple top-2 experts:\n- GLaM from Google\n- \u201cFacebookMoE\u201d from Facebook\nGeneralist Language Model (GLaM) ([Du et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06905.pdf))\nSpecification:\n- 1.2 trillion parameters (GPT-3 had 175 billion parameters)\n- 64 experts (not that many), 64 layers, 32K hidden units\n- Each token activates 95B (8% of 1.2T) of the parameters\nOther upgrades:\n- Created new dataset (GLaM dataset) of 1.6 trillion tokens of webpages, forums, books, news, etc.\n- Relative positional embeddings, Gated linear units, GeLU activation function, RMSNorm (not LayerNorm)\n- Skip weight updates / rollback to earlier checkpoint if encounter NaN/Inf.\n- \u201cWith the above tricks carefully implemented, we observe that the training of sparsely activated models at all scales becomes quite stable.\u201d\nResults:\n- 1/3 of the cost to train compared to GPT-3\n- Evaluated on same benchmarks as GPT-3 (open-domain question answering, reading comprehension, SuperGLUE, etc.)\n- Achieved better 0-shot and 1-shot performance compared to GPT-3 (especially performant on knowledge-intensive tasks)\n- Note: they did not evaluate in the few-shot, where GPT-3 is stronger\nResults on WinoGender:\n- Example:\nThe nurse notified the patient that{her/his,their}shift would be ending in an hour. - GPT-3: 64.2%\n- GLaM: 71.7%\n- \u201che\u201d examples: 70.8%\n- \u201cshe\u201d examples: 72.5%\n- stereotypical examples: 71.7%\n- anti-stereotypical (\u201cgotcha\u201d) examples: 71.7%\n- GLaM has less gender bias (as measured by this benchmark).\nFacebookMoE ([Artetxe et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10684.pdf))\nSetup:\n- Trained a 1.1T parameter model\n- 512 experts (more than GLaM), 32 layers, 4096 hidden units\n- Trained on 112 billion tokens on webpages, forums, books, news, etc.\n- Strong gains for smaller models, diminishing gains for larger models\nResults on [StereoSet](https://stereoset.mit.edu/explore/dev/):\n- Example:\nThe assistant went to work. {She brought her boss coffee., She was valued for her input.} - Stereotype bias gets worse with increase model size (counterpoint to the GLaM results).\nDecentralized mixture-of-experts ([Ryabinin & Gusev, 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04013.pdf))\nMotivation:\n- So far, the mixture-of-experts was motivated purely from a perspective of a\ncentralorganization (e.g., Google or Facebook) scaling up a massive large language model. - However, mixture-of-experts naturally suggests a much more radical\ndecentralization. - The\n[Azure supercomputer cluster](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/)used to train GPT-3 costs $250 million. - How can we harness the\n[hundreds of millions](https://lisbdnet.com/how-many-computers-are-there-in-the-world/)of consumer PCs?

Let us first focus on sequence-to-sequence tasks using an encoder-decoder framework:\nExample (open-book question answering):\n- Input \\(x\\):\nWhat is the capital of Canada? - Output \\(y\\):\nOttawa\nRecall that [BART](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461.pdf) and [T5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) are examples of encoder-decoder models:\nthat are trained on denoising objectives; for example:\n- Input \\(x\\): Thank you\nme to your party week. - Output \\(y\\):\nfor inviting last\nRetrieval. Let us assume that we have a store \\(S\\), which is a set of sequences (usually, documents or passages).\nIntuitively, a retrieval-based model generates:\nRetrievea relevant sequence(s) \\(z\\) based on input \\(x\\).Generatethe output \\(y\\) given retrieved sequence(s) \\(z\\) and input \\(x\\).\nExample (open-book question answering):\n- Input \\(x\\):\nWhat is the capital of Canada? - Retrieval \\(z\\):\nOttawa is the capital city of Canada. - Output \\(y\\):\nOttawa\nNearest neighbors as a special case:\n- \\(S\\) is the training set.\n- Retrieve the \\((x',y') \\in S\\) whose \\(x'\\) is most similar to \\(x\\).\n- Generate \\(y = y'\\).\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) ([Lewis et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf))\nFormally, the RAG-Sequence model is defined as follows:\n\\[p(y \\mid x) = \\sum_{z \\in S} \\underbrace{p(z \\mid x)}_\\text{retriever} \\underbrace{p(y \\mid z, x)}_\\text{generator}.\\]In practice, the summation \\(z \\in S\\) is replaced by the top-k (analogous to choosing the top 1 or 2 experts for mixture of experts).\nRetriever: Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) ([Karpukhin et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04906.pdf)).\n- Considers on passages of 100 words with title of Wikipedia article\n- Trained on query, positive example, negative examples: \\((q, p^+, p^-_1, \\dots, p^-_n)\\) from QA datasets (NaturalQuestions, TriviQA, etc.)\n- Negative passages: random + passages retrieved using BM25 on \\(q\\) that don\u2019t contain the answer\n- Inference: uses\n[FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)(Facebook AI Similarity Search)\nGenerator.\n- Use BART-large (400M parameters) where input is retrieved passage \\(z\\) concatenated with input \\(x\\)\n- Recall BART was trained on denoising objectives (e.g., masking) on web, news, books, stories\nTraining.\n- Initialize with BART, DPR (initialized with BERT).\n- Tune \\(\\text{BART}\\) and \\(\\BERT_\\text{q}\\).\nExperiments.\n- Example of RAG-Token on Jeopardy question generation given input\nHemingway:\n- Outperforms non-retrieval methods:\nFor comparison, GPT-3 (few-shot): NaturalQuestions (29.9%), WebQuestions (41.5%), TriviaQA (71.2%)\nRETRO ([Borgeaud et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04426.pdf))\n- Retrieve based on\nchunksof 32 tokens - Store: 2 trillion tokens\n- 7 billion parameters (25 times fewer parameters than GPT-3)\n- Use frozen BERT for retrieval (don\u2019t update)\n- Trained on MassiveText (same dataset used to train Gopher)\nResults:\n- Performs very well on language modeling\n- NaturalQuestions accuracy: 45.5% (SOTA is 54.7%)\nDiscussion\n- The retrieval-based models are highly geared towards knowledge-intensive, question answering tasks.\n- Beyond scalability, retrieval-based models provide\ninterpretabilityand ability to update the store. - Unclear whether these models have the same general-purpose capabilities as a dense Transformer.\nSummary\n- In order to scale, need to go beyond dense Transformers.\n- Mixture-of-experts and retrieval-based methods are more efficient.\n- How to design the best, scalable architectures is still an open question.\nFurther reading\nMixture of experts:\n[Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06538.pdf).Noam M.
